Isola first appeared in <cite>Young Oxford</cite> in September,
1902, and ran in serial form for six
months through that publication. The drama
itself was written many years ago. It is not for me to
deal with its merits or demerits. These are handled
generously by the true-hearted and honest gentleman
to whom I have the honour to dedicate the piece. At
nineteen or twenty the heart is more concerned with
ideals, than the brain with thoughts of literary excellence.
The soul, longing to uphold Truth and destroy
Falsehood, forgets the p’s and q’s of literary etiquette,
and I fear influences the pen to give premier consideration
to the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>The drama, Isola, opposes many established customs,
but if these rest their claim to existence on antiquated
and erroneous ideas, they must be remorsely uprooted.
Man cannot make <i>lasting</i> laws. That is in Nature’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>power alone, for Progress, Research and enlarged
Thought Force will not be bound by the cramped and
immature ideas of gloomy ages gone. Superstition
has persecuted many, but the time has come to repudiate
it, for in its wake follows Misery, and to it is due
the sorrows of Mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>In my preface to <cite>Young Oxford</cite> occurs the following
paragraph:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us in imagination soar above our Earth and
look down on it revolving in space, and then look
round on that infinite space, in which myriads of other
worlds are also revolving. As we look down on our
Earth, shall we not see upon its surface the glories of
Nature’s beauty, and the hideous scars inflicted thereon
by Man? As we look down on these unsavory sights,
and realise how contemptible they are, shall we not
resolve to eradicate them and make the picture one of
peace, contentment and joy? Instead of looking
down on blood, carnage, cruelty, torture, suffering and
<i>injustice</i>, let us look down on the reverse, and in order
to do so, let us realise the simple, rational and natural
ideas of ‘Isola.’ Advanced, are they? Not a bit of it.
Unusual? Maybe. But because they are unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>does not make them wrong. Nothing Natural can be
aught but right, for it is the offspring of Nature, the
only true God. <i>‘Isola’ demands the practice of the
true laws of the only true God.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall always stand by this assertion.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, I desire to make the following statement.
My publishers have pointed out to me that in
some of the names of places and countries I have
chosen, there might arise cause for the belief that my
characters in Isola are drawn from life. I am glad to
here state frankly that, in so far as royal personages
are concerned, they are purely fictitious and concern no
living human being whatever. Customs and etiquettes
I certainly openly attack. Who would not who desires,
as I do, to see justice done, not only to the poor disinherited
human and suffering non-human, but also to
our disinherited and manacled rulers? The unjust
laws in regard to woman I also vigorously attack, and
for Superstitious <i>Falsehood</i> I have no reverence whatever.
Nevertheless, judge me as they may, let no one
accuse me of Mockery or Infidelity, for I innately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>worship the Inscrutable and believe in Nature, both of
which are God alone. Let us have “<i>Truth at any
price</i>,” no matter what idols we have to cast down to
attain it. In the attainment of Truth, Justice, Love
and Kindness shall rule in the place of Selfishness,
Cruelty and Greed, and Fair Play be meted out to all.</p>

Though I cannot but be gratified by the
Dedication of this Drama to me, it does
not, and was not intended to influence my judgment.
Its noble and unusual aims of “demanding Justice
<i>for every living thing</i>, from Ruler to Subject, <i>of either
sex</i>, and for the brute creation and advocating the reign
of Truth and destruction of Imposture”—could not
fail to command my sympathy and admiration.
Written when the authoress was a girl, the drama
is a marvel of thought and power. I know of no
one, save Shelley, who, at so early an age was troubled
about the questions she discusses with such generous
passionateness. Apart from immaturities of expression,
natural to immaturity of years, the Drama is a
wonderful piece of writing. But the occasional youthfulness
of style creates the greater surprise at the
maturity of conception and often original expression.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>The Drama opens with what George Henry Lewes
entitled the great problem of “Life and Mind.” The
first words Isola speaks are:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vast attribute of the Eternal mind.
Thought, and thy clinging twin, fair Memory.
Art thou and she imperishable parts
Of Life and Matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is a perfect philosophic theory excellently put.
Surely never Queen before was set to answer such
questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Isola is a Lady Macbeth of a nobler kind, but has
the same undaunted spirit. She is bold but tender—and
only inflexible for the Right. Her conception
of womanly independence is <i>original in literature</i>.
The legal and ecclesiastical restrictions woven about
her, which limit her freedom and frustrate her equality,
are discerned with great acumen and described with
great power. Such indignation at wrong; such
energy and eloquence in its denunciation, such devotion,
sacrifice and unbewailing courage—constitute the
Rebel Queen a new inspiration. Rugged expressions
which occur here and there, seem congenial to the
rugged and impetuous times in which the scenes are
laid. Even there there is gold in the quartz. Keats
tells us that Columbus when he first saw new lands from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>the peak of Darien, viewed them with “glad surprise.”
In like manner the reader comes upon fresh unexpected
sentences. The moral interest of the Drama
has great charm. Every speech, however impassioned,
has a certain quality of restraint; amid fiery denunciation
of regal and legal wrong, there is no insurgency
against law, but against <i>unjust</i> law Isola abdicates
her throne in generosity to her rival. Her love of
justice and right brings her to the scaffold, which she
contemplates with quiet heroism, in which there is no
fear, or flutter of fear—neither bravado nor shrinking.
No hysterical word escapes her. No word of reproach,
such as Madame Roland uttered, is spoken by Isola.
Her sole desire is to save others and to serve the
cause of right. As the tragic death of a woman,
capable both of heroism and reflection, the last hours
of Fortunatus are memorable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will not need to be told of the felicity
in the invention of names; nor of the spirited scenes
in the public Hall, where the orators of the People
speak; nor of the intrigues of courts, nor the conspiracy
of priests—which make these pages alive with
interest. The speech of Merani on the consciousness
of her approaching death, has queenly dignity, as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>as flashes of true poetry. The reader will see in
the “Last Watch” of Fortunatus on the heights of
Avenamore, the beauty, the dignity, the determination
without defiance, of Isola. Intellectual intrepidity in
defence of the Right, is the soul of the Drama of the
Disinherited.</p>

Isola, Princess of Bernia, loves Escanior, one of
her father’s youthful bodyguard. The Prince
of Bernia has, however, promised her in marriage
to his liege lord and sovereign, Hector, paramount King
of the <i>Saxens</i>, <i>Scotas</i> and <i>Ernas</i>, inhabitants of the
three islands <i>Saxa</i>, <i>Scota</i> and <i>Bernia</i>, situated in the
<i>Emerald</i> Ocean, in the <i>Planet Erthris, or Erth</i>, and
together forming the Kingdom of Saxscoberland. Isola
and Escanior attempt flight, but are pursued by the
Prince of Bernia, and captured in their boat, whereupon
the Prince condemns Escanior to instant death,
and he is stabbed and flung into the sea, his unhappy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>love, Isola, being borne away to become the wife of
Hector, King of the Saxscober people, and shortly afterwards
the nuptials are celebrated.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c009'><i>Isola</i>, Queen of the Saxscobers, sitting alone soliloquises:
  “Vast attribute of the Eternal mind,
  Thought, and thy clinging twin, fair Memory,
  Art thou and she imperishable parts
  Of Life and Matter, or but sudden sparks
  Born to expire and never live again?
  What art thou Thought and what is Memory
  If not the factors of undying Life,
  Which draws from Death fresh force to recreate
  And fashion new existence from Decay?
  Oh! Thought; oh! Memory, <i>Ye cannot die</i>,
  Ye can but sink to sleep in Death’s cold arms
  To wake again, a recreated force,
  Part of a universe which cannot end,
  Because its function is to recreate,
  Evolving Life from Nature’s boundless store,
  Nature the all Eternal, only God,
  Creator of all things known and unknown,
  The Great Inscrutable, which mind alone
  Shall understand when it is perfected.
  Escanior; Oh! Escanior, where art thou?
  Fair Memory recalls thee to thy love,
  Isola, who will never yield her heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>  To mortal man, for it is thine alone.
  My golden haired, my blue-eyed Escanior!
  They murdered thee before these starting eyes,
  They forced me to become another’s bride,
  They forced that horror on my shrinking soul
  And left me to endure its fearful pain.
  One thing they could not do. They could not take
  My heart away, or force it to vibrate
  For any other but thy own dear self,
  My murdered love, my vanished Escanior.
  Thought! speak to me. Ah! tell me where his is,
  What part of Nature is his woven with?
  When will my body, mingling with the Earth
  Quit this curst slavery and twine once more
  Its arms around the Love that cannot die?
  Oh! Thought so penetrating, so divine,
  Fathom for me the Knowledge that I seek.
  Shew me where I can find Escanior,
  Tell me and I will burst my prison bars,
  And seek with him the liberty I crave.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Hector</i>, King of the Saxscobers, joins her exclaiming:
  “Dreaming again Isola. Truth, thou art
  A sorry bride for a great King <i>to own</i>,
  A King whom many virgins yearned to win,
  And whom thou shrinkest from with mute appeal
  In thy sad eyes that I should let thee be.
  Hast thou no sense of honour? Where the vows
  Which Holy Church commanded thee to make
  To love me, <i>and obey</i> and reverence me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>  Yes, me thy Lord and Master, thou my slave?
  Hast thou then no respect for pledges given,
  And priestly exhortation? How is it
  Thou shun’st me as thou dost, breaking the vows
  Thou mad’st to God to be my loving mate?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “Hector, <i>I</i> made <i>no vow, my lips were mute</i>,
  <i>I</i> did <i>not</i> utter the accursed lie,
  Which would have fallen from them, had I vowed
  To love, and honour, and obey a man
  I could not love or honour. Nor would I
  Lose self respect by swearing to <i>obey</i>
  One who should be my equal and co-mate,
  But <i>not</i> my Lord and Master, I his slave.
  What care <i>I</i> for your Holy Church, or for
  The priestly exhortations of its <i>Men</i>?
  Why should these <i>Mockers of the laws of God</i>,
  Make laws for Women, whom they treat as naught?
  Tell me not Hector, that their words are God’s,
  God’s laws are not immoral as theirs are,
  For God is Nature, God is not that fiend
  Which priestly doctrine has set up on high
  And bidden us remember and adore.
  Remember what has never been, nor is?
  Adore a myth ladened with cruel crimes,
  The base conception of ignoble minds?
  Never! Isola worships one <i>true</i> God,
  The vast, inscrutable, unfathomed force,
  <i>Which nothing but a perfect mind shall solve,
  Which nothing but Perfection shall attain</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>  Hector, you call yourself a mighty King,
  A ruler wise and just, guided by laws
  Called by their framers Righteous. Go to, King!
  I tell you <i>they are rotten to the core</i>,
  Fruits of a tree <i>planted by priests</i> and men
  <i>Without the aid of Woman’s guiding hand</i>.
  Small wonder they are false and trample down
  The heads of Justice, Mercy and Great Truth.
  As well might Man attempt alone the task
  Of making Life without the Woman’s aid,
  As seek to frame those human laws, which bind
  Communities together and enforce
  Their will upon <i>the disinherited</i>.
  For <i>all around, these outlaws of our Erth</i>
  Wander and prowl in seething discontent.
  Men, women, children, all are victims of
  Unnatural laws, Nature’s base antichrists.
  Am I not a poor disinherited?
  Is not that lonely woman far away,
  That woman dwelling in fair Scota’s isle,
  Whom, ere you tied with me ignoble ties,
  You treated as a wife, who bore you seed,
  And loved you Hector as I love you not,
  Is she not too a Disinherited,
  One of the outlaws fashioned by your laws?
  Is not the son she bore you, Vergli called,
  Your rightful heir? Is not the child you force
  On me, by Nature illegitimate,
  Although the priests declare it blest by God?
  Why did you leave her to dishonour me?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>  I did not seek to be your crownèd slave,
  I loved but one, my dear Escanior,
  They murdered him and tore me from his side
  To be your lawful, sacred prostitute!
  Out on the creed that dares to order thus,
  Out on it, and its superstitious cant,
  Out on the monstrous God <i>it</i> has set up
  And made the Sponsor of its ranting lies.
  No, Hector, such a creed will never stand,
  Or be professed by <i>thinking</i>, honest hearts.
  ’Twas only made to gull the ignorant,
  And sway the superstitious multitude.
  <i>All round you cry the disinherited,
  Go lift the loads from off the poor oppressed,
  Strike down all civil and religious laws
  Which mock at Nature and withhold from Man
  Those rights which Nature gives to everyone.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Hector.</i> “Isola, prate no longer blasphemy,
  Cease thy revilings of the Orthodox,
  Merani was not wed by Holy Church,
  Who judges her unwedded, and her son,
  Vergli, my first born, illegitimate.
  I bow to Holy Church, the fount of God
  And its behests I cannot disobey.
  Vergli is not my heir, the child from thee
  Will be <i>The</i> Prince of Scota, if a son,
  And dost <i>thou</i> dare to question <i>his</i> true right,
  Thou <i>his own</i> mother and King Hector’s wife,
  Thou the crowned Queen of mighty Saxscober?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>  Cease woman, nor defame God’s holy name,
  That God who fashioned Woman out of Man.
  Who are the Disinherited of Erth?
  Would’st have men equal, and to women give
  Those sacred rights which Holy Church declares
  Are man’s alone, given him by his God?
  Cease thy revolt against the Orthodox,
  Bow to revealed religion and become
  A lover of Conventionality.
  Isola, I command it, I, thy King,
  And, <i>as thy husband, lord and master too</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “No, Hector, <i>I will never</i> bow the knee
  To Humbug or to the black fiend Untruth.
  I say <i>the</i> Prince of Scota <i>is Vergli</i>
  And not the son that I, alas! may bear.
  Poor innocent! Born to commit a wrong.
  What am I, the crowned Queen of Saxscober?
  A creature, a dependent on <i>your</i> life,
  Who bears the <i>empty</i> title of a Queen
  Without the powers which <i>should</i> accompany it,
  And who at your demise is ousted by
  The very child who prattles at her knee,
  Who thus is early taught to scorn that part
  Of his own being, given him by her,
  Far more a parent than his father even,
  Whom he calls mother. No, no, Hector, King,
  Your slave I am, but most unwillingly,
  Give me my freedom, <i>give to everyone
  The equal right to strive for and attain</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>  <i>The opportunities, which Life affords
  To those who have the chance to grasp their hands</i>.
  Unto the Orthodox <i>I</i> will <i>not</i> bow

  The homage of Isola. That which Truth
  Proves unmistakably by Nature’s laws,
  To be revealed, I will obey, but Cant
  And rant, and superstition, out on them!
  Isola shuns them as she would a plague.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> Solus, looking through them:
  “Home of my fathers, where I claim the right

  The Prince of Scota. By that law I am
  My fathers heir, and the young fledgling boy,
  Who steals from me the title I should hold,
  Mocks at me, I, the Disinherited!
  Ay, disinherited; for he and I
  Are both the offspring of a common sire,
  Who called me son, long prior to the day
  When my young brother first beheld the light,
  And took the title which is mine alone.
  Does not this base injustice cast a slur
  Upon my most beloved mother’s name?
  Did she not wed my sire by Scota’s law?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>  Am I not part of her as well as him?
  By what <i>unnatural</i> law is she denied
  The right to bear the title of The Queen?
  Does not the very act, which weds the two,
  And by the law of Nature makes them one,
  Proclaim a union most legitimate?
  Yet ye, Oh! Prelates, hold aloft a <i>book,
  Concocted in the gloomy ages gone</i>,
  By men as selfish and unjust as ye,
  Who flaunt the Act of Nature, and declare
  It wicked and unbinding, unless blest
  By superstitious Mummery, conceived
  By the immoral Prophets of the Past.
  They dare to call my pure-souled mother bad.
  Dub her a wanton, robe her name in shame!
  Curses upon them and the ranting Cant
  Which voices such a foul and hideous lie.
  Away with it! Perdition to its name,
  I will for ever be its fiercest foe;
  I, who love Nature, the true, only God,
  I, Vergli, the poor <i>bastard</i> son of him
  Who lives in legalized Adultery
  With the unhappy and degraded slave,
  Which his priest-ridden Creed has called The Queen,
  I swear to fight it to its very death.
  I vow it! I, the Disinherited.”—</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Enter Maxim</i>, who has overheard the last words.
  “What, Vergli here? ‘The Disinherited!’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>  Sighing o’er wrongs. Planning Revolution.
  Dost know King Hector is abroad to-night,
  And will return this way without a doubt?
  What will he say if he should find thee here?
  Put thee in prison, man, most probably.
  Oh!  thou art rash to venture thus, as ’twere
  Into the precincts of The Lion’s den,
  The person of The Disinherited.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “Maxim, that’s why I came; I fain would speak
  With my liege lord and King, and Father too,
  I would plead just once more for my own rights
  And crave respect for my dear Mother’s name.
  She lies sore sick, sick unto very death,
  That Mother, dearer to me than my life,
  She, who should be our fair Saxscober’s Queen,
  Not as is poor Isola, a mere slave,
  But reigning all conjointly with my sire,
  I, the presumptive heir to him and her
  And not the <i>forced usurper of her rights</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Maxim.</i> “Oh! these are dreams, Vergli; thou dream’st strange dreams;
  Woman is but the appanage of man,
  <i>At least our priestly tutors tell us so.
  ’Tis they who have assigned that place to her.</i>
  Would’st thou make her Man’s equal?  Have a care,
  Freedom to Woman would doom Privilege,
  And that we have secured from ages old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>  By help of Superstition and false gods,
  Who bade the Woman bow the knee to Man.
  Mind’st thou how in the days that have gone by
  Thou had’st a sister, little Merani?
  She was thy elder by a year or more,
  Did she live now, would’st put her in thy place
  And as the eldest born declare her heir,
  Princess of Scota and prospective Queen
  Of fair Saxscober, leaving out thyself
  As a nonentity and younger born?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “Aye, that I would. Fervently I say it,
  <i>So long as Primogeniture is law,
  Consistency</i> declares <i>the eldest born</i>,
  And <i>not the male first-born alone</i>, the heir.
  Saxscober’s laws do not deny the right
  To Woman to inherit, when no boy
  Stands in the way depriving her of such.
  Why should a Woman therefore lose this right
  Because a younger brother sees the light?
  No Maxim, if Merani were alive,
  I’d dub her Scota’s Princess and declare
  That she was the true heiress of this realm.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Maxim.</i> “Ah! well Vergli; I see thy point, <i>’tis just</i>,
  But Justice <i>is not loved by many men</i>.
  He who would see it reign, <i>is seldom found</i>;
  ’Tis but a selfish creature, average man!
  And yet methinks <i>he is not all</i> to blame,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>  Why do not Women teach him in his youth

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “Because <i>they know no better</i>. They are slaves
  <i>Drilled to believe</i> the priestly fashioned laws
  Part of Divine instruction and command.
  In the dark ages gone, the prophets knew
  That Woman, to be held in check, must bend
  Prostrate before the superstitious spell
  Which has enveloped her with obscure mist
  And hidden from her sight The Promised Land.
  And so, poor thing, she hugs her chains and drills
  Her very children to believe them just,
  And if amidst these children, a girl child
  Dares to dispute this creed, the world aghast
  Gapes at her shouting, ‘How so miscreant!
  What! <i>You</i> say; <i>You</i> are disinherited?
  Presume <i>you</i> thus to question <i>God’s</i> decree
  And the most holy spouter of His Will,
  <i>The Great Saint Saul, so chivalrous, so just</i>,
  Who bade the Woman sanctify herself
  By humbly subjecting herself to man.’
  ‘But,’ cries the child, and Maxim you will know
  I quote Isola’s words, which she has dared
  To fling broadcast upon a gaping world,
  ‘But I deny that <i>such a God exists</i>,
  And that he ever lived to say such things.
  He is the fabrication of those men
  Progenitors of <i>Chivalrous Saint Saul</i>!
  As chivalrous and just as that <i>Good Man</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>  Who, I declare, at every turn of speech
  Insults the woman and proclaims her slave.’
  Thus speaks Isola, poor Isola, who
  Bore the young boy who holds the name I claim
  Of ‘Prince of Scota,’ unto my own sire;
  And thus assisted, though unwillingly,
  In rivetting upon my mother’s neck,
  And on that of her sex the cruel chains,
  Cast round them by a man-made, man-shaped God,
  And rivetted upon them by <i>Saint</i> Saul!
  Small wonder that Isola’s loud protest
  <i>Has roused some of the disinherited</i>,
  As it has spurred me also to revolt;
  Aye, here I stand, ‘The Disinherited,’
  In spirit speaking to that lonely soul,
  Dwelling within <i>that Palace’s cold Prison</i>,
  And join with her my cry against foul Wrong.
  But hark! Voices! Maxim retire. The King.”</p>

  Father, I pray thee harken to those words,
  Be just, be brave; Oh! Father, be a King
  In deed as well as name, be that, and more,
  Be a true Man, dear Nature’s genuine son,

  The offspring of a superstitious creed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A large room on an upper floor in a housed, situate in a
side street, leading off the populous thoroughfare
and district of Stairway. The room is full of men
and women, of poor but respectable class. They
are listening to a somewhat eccentric looking man,
who is addressing them; Scrutus by name.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Time</span>: Early Dawn.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Scrutus</i> (pleadingly). “Be honest, comrades, show that which men lack,
  The Courage of their own convictions. Hark!
  <i>Truth’s silver voice is pleading for you</i> now.
  ’Tis Vergli, Hector’s son, who has flung down
  The gauntlet of defiance against Wrong.
  Vergli, himself, a disinherited;
  ’Tis he who has proclaimed our sacred rights,
  The rights which human beings claim by right,
  Right, moral and divine, and by divine
  I mean, as you all know, by Nature’s law.
  What are these rights? They are to live and be,
  <i>To have access to Opportunity</i>,
  To eat a wholesome meal once in the day,
  To be afforded work and honest toil,
  To be assured the idle shall not loaf,
  To know the infirm shall have free succour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>  The aged live in comfortable homes,
  To be assured likewise that every sex
  Shall have a voice in governing our land,
  That Privilege shall never be usurped,
  And that <i>in Merit only, rank shall find
  Its resting place</i>, which is its rightful due.
  We have the Human Right likewise to rule
  Our lives by laws divine. Vergli has said,
  And Vergli speaks with reason, ‘that no law
  Should bind Humanity but Human law,
  Which law is Nature, therefore Perfection.’
  A natural religion is our right,
  Religion founded by the laws of God,
  Not Superstition’s God, as made by priests,
  But God as Nature represents this force,
  Whose laws no man-made creed can controvert.
  Rest certain, Nature orders all things best,
  And when we seek to flout her, sorrow comes.
  Look round ye, comrades. Nature is oppressed,
  On every side the disinherited
  Roam speechless, mutely wond’ring whence their pain,
  <i>Begging as Charity what is their right</i>;
  Right filched from them by those who mock and scout
  As wicked and immoral, Nature’s laws.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Verita</i> (interposing, speaks):
  “Scrutus is right, he voices Vergli’s words,
  Words which are gold and silver in our ears.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>  If we would win the common rights detailed
  We must combine, and practice what we preach.
  What do we seek to win? Just human rights,
  And to be governed by diviner laws
  Than now prevail. Our revolution is
  The evolution of both Thought and Mind,
  Which working upwards yearns to find the Truth.
  Wander in Stairway’s slums. Is Truth found there?
  No, nothing but a huge and monster lie,
  The offspring of a Superstitious creed,
  That creed which Sanctimonious bids us hug,
  And which is bolstered up by Church and State.
  What has it done for us, that boasted creed?
  Why made us the poor disinherited,
  The outcasts of a sham Society,
  In which Sham’s influence is paramount;
  And when we cry ‘Reform,’ retorts ‘Revolt,’
  And dubs our movement ‘Social Revolution.’
  Our noble Vergli calls it ‘Moral Force,’
  Seeking a level where it can abide,
  And influence entire Society.
  And thus it is, dear comrades, without doubt,
  And therefore to attain it we must work,
  Using all forces which we can command.
  We seek <i>not Anarchy, that’s not our creed,
  We ask for Human rights and Human laws,
  For true religion, and not Superstition</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>A Voice.</i> “I hear a step. Surely it is Vergli’s.”</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>[<i>Enter Vergli. All rise and greet him with looks of affection.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “The top of the morning! to you, kind friends,
  Our burrow then is not evacuated?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>A Voice.</i> “No, noble Vergli! but the ferrets prowl
  And sniff around its entrance, seeking prey,
  The secret ‘peerers’ of our sharp Ardrigh
  Are searching for that which they may devour.
  Vergli’s ‘free lances,’ who are just the nuts
  Which Sanctimonious loves to gobble up,
  Having first pulverised to dust their shells.
  But every dog enjoys its day. We will
  Open his grace’s eyes, and make them stare
  When Vergli is returned to Parliament,
  And his most graciousness’s abject slave
  Is given the ‘good-bye’ by Stairway’s votes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “How goes it, Scrutus? How now, Verita,
  Are you and he making good headway still?
  Shall we succeed this time? How go the funds?
  Low, I’m afraid? What no? Why do you smile
  And shake your head and laugh so pleasantly?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Verita.</i> “Because the silver lining of <i>our cloud</i>
  Is shining brightly. Stairway is aroused,
  And Isola has filled our purse with gold.
  She sent it secretly ‘<i>for Vergli’s cause</i>,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>  But <i>we</i> know well it is Isola’s gift.
  That poor Isola, pining, as the lark
  Pines in its gilded cage, with eyes intent
  Upon the Heav’n its cagèd spirit craves.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “Isola, ah! yes, she <i>is</i> Vergli’s friend,
  The heart of that poor captive beats with love
  For all the disinherited of Erth,
  Be they of human or of brute creation,
  Knowing that <i>All Creation</i> has its rights,
  The dumb brute and the voluble human.
  From both of which the sanctimonious laws,
  Which rule Society, have filched their dues.
  Isola is in heart and deed a Queen,
  Not that gay puppet which man dresses up
  In tawdry garments trimmed with tinsel daubs,
  Pulling the strings which make the puppet dance
  The weird, fantastic jig his fancy loves,
  But what a monarch should be, a kind friend,
  The people’s Maypole, round which Joy is rife
  And laughter is not drowned in Suff’ring’s tears.
  Yet our false laws deny <i>her</i> human rights,
  Class her with the poor idiot whose dulled brain,
  Diseased by causes physical, is mute,
  And cannot use the right, which nature gives
  To all the human family of this erth,
  No matter of which sex its items are,
  That right to think, and speak, and fashion laws
  Demanded by Necessity. Progress
  Demands new laws, and busy evolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>  Will not be bound by antiquated thought,
  Whose crude ideas no longer satisfy
  The ever moving forces of Mankind.
  Yet Isola, proud Sanctimonious says,
  Has not the right to vote or represent,
  Or be that, which she is, a human being!
  Is she not—leastwise Sanctimonious says,—
  An offcast of the man, piece of his bone,
  That piece, <i>a rib</i>, filched by God from his side,
  Which he can pet, mal-use, treat as a thing
  Dependent on him, not of much account,
  Unless it be to pander to his wants
  Physical or Political, a slave.
  Bone of his bone? Ha! Ha! a splintered bone?
  Or stay! <i>Perhaps</i> the long sought missing link,
  The bone of that lost tail! <i>I have it now</i>;
  Oh! happy thought! Oh! Sanctimonious,
  What will you pay me for this missing link?
  No wonder <i>we</i> have searched for it in vain,
  Seeing your Deity made use of it
  To fashion her, to whom no doubt <i>He</i> said,
  ‘Woman, thou art indeed <i>the tail of Man</i>.’<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  A <i>vast</i> idea, is it not, Verita?
  Are you not fascinated by the thought?

  <i>The missing link</i> between the ape and man.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><i>Verita</i> (laughing). “Oh! thought divine! Who dares to question now

  Haste Vergli! Haste! Give Scientists the clue,

  If only you can reconcile that tale

  And stitch up all your little differences,
  Hold a most amicable, state Pow Wow,

  Of a revised and up-to-date religion,
  Smoking together fragrant Pipes of Peace.
  But Vergli, apart from joking, good news!
  Ay excellent the news I have received.
  Isola has assured your cause success
  By sending us the sinews that we lacked.
  I have no fear. Vergli, you’ll be returned,
  The Sanctimonious nominee o’erturned,

  Or lead you forward to fair Freedom’s goal,
  As King in deed and not alone in name.
  Take Vergli’s gratitude. He ne’er forgets.
  His aim will be to reign within your hearts,
  And reap his people’s love, faithful and true.
  And now, good morning to you, see the sun
  Is clasping in its rays those shamefaced clouds
  Which Night is beckoning, as off she flies,
  To leave to Day an equal spell of rule
  As she has held. We must not linger here,
  A sadder scene demands my presence now,
  So let us leave our burrow solitary,

    <div><i>Glen Glory on the Firth of Glory.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A cottage overlooking the Firth, in the island of Scota.
The cottage is covered with climbing roses and
creepers, and flowers abound in rich profusion.
The cottage nestles amidst stately trees, and grassy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>glades surround it, and in these glades rabbits and
pheasants feed in perfect peace and security. In
this woodland retreat every kind of bird finds a
home, and their song gives glory to their joy and
happiness. Here, too, the roe deer dwells amidst
the bracken and the squirrel is permitted to revel
in Life amongst the dark pines which rear aloft
their spreading branches. A rippling burn runs
through the whole Glen, making its way towards
the sea, and its waters shelter the shy brown trout,
who leads, as far as man is concerned, an undisturbed
existence. Life is sacred in Glen Glory by
order of its Mistress, Merani.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Merani</i> (stretched on a couch in her bedroom, close to an open window. She is alone. Time: Evening):
  “So this is Death? How quietly it comes,
  Creeping like Evening’s shadows slowly on.
  I feel its presence drawing very nigh,
  Its cold breath hovering around my face,
  Like the chill wind which heralds in a storm.
  God of my heart! <i>I</i> do <i>not</i> fear its touch;
  <i>It is from Thee it comes, so must be right</i>,
  The Pow’r that rules all things, that put me here
  And takes me hence, will clasp me in its arms
  And make <i>me still a part of endless Life</i>,
  Part of the Mighty Universe divine,
  Part <i>of that matter indestructible,
  Whose very death creates and recreates,
  Fashioning Life from out of all decay</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>  Oh! Life, thou art a strange enigma here.
  Marred by the vices and the sins of Man,
  Distorted by his weird, fantastic creed
  Which shapes a most impossible, dread God
  And makes him parent of unnatural laws.
  This is the God who judges me outcast,
  A prostitute, a disinherited,
  Because I would not utter shameful vows,
  And call myself the slave of e’en a King.
  And yet by the true laws, of the <i>true</i> God,
  Nature, the one and only God I own,
  I am the wife of Hector, as he is
  The husband, whom I loved, and loving still
  Claim as my wedded co-mate, though he has
  Proclaimed me outcast and forced to his side
  That poor Isola, loved of Escanior,
  Fair Escanior to whom her heart was wed,
  Who died before her eyes unwillingly,
  For life was sweet to him when she was nigh,
  <i>And bright to her so long as he was near</i>.
  Ah! well, we suffer when we cast defiance
  At Nature, so must willing hands strike down
  The superstitions and the lies of Men,
  And fight to win fair Justice and bright Truth.
  Vergli, my son, dear Scota’s rightful prince,
  Have I not given thee these thoughts of mine?
  Yes, and have bidden thee spread them afar
  And labour to achieve Success for them.
  Vergli, it seems to me thou drawest nigh
  Often we think of those who think of us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>  What binds together sudden intercourse,
  Community of thought? Spirits blending?
  What hidden force of interchanging thought
  Brings this about? Oh! Science thou art dense,
  Thou hast a vast immensity to learn.
  Clear out the Charnel House of thy dull brain
  And flood it with that penetrating thought
  Which some have sneered at as Imagination.
  Where would all Truth have been but for its aid?
  Sometimes its shapes are vague and most obscure,
  As all conception is, e’en Life itself,
  Which from a speck becomes a thinking brain,
  Fruit of the tiny atom first conceived.
  Thus shall Thought be the ovule of a Life
  At present far beyond our comprehension.
  A life whose thought, in Evolution’s arms
  Shall far transcend the ovule of to-day,
  Bringing us knowledge that <i>shall</i> pierce <i>the veil</i>
  That veil which hides the secret of Creation.”</p>

  I’ll work for it unto my latest breath.
  I’ll plant the seed <i>thou gav’st me</i>. It may be

  And in the reaping <i>thou</i> shalt win the day.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Merani.</i> “It matters little who will reap the grain,
  So it <i>is</i> reaped. Our work is Evolution,

  The ceaseless ever active spinning wheels
  Which weave the vast materials of space

  Here I, advancing into that unknown,
  Upon whose threshold I shall shortly stand,
  Counsel thee Vergli to work endlessly
  To find the Truth of all things by research
  And by <i>developing the Thought of Man</i>.
  But Thought will never soar to heights sublime,
  Those heights where dwell the knowledge that we seek,
  Save in the brain of recreated Man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>  By which I mean the Human perfected.
  It is not perfect to be full of lust,
  It is not perfect to have cruel hearts,
  It is not perfect to oppress the weak,
  Or to deny to all and everything
  The rights which Nature gives them as their own.
  The perfect man will not delight in war,
  Nor crave to make his food of bleeding flesh,
  The <i>Vivisection Hell</i> and Slaughter House,
  The pastime known as ‘Sport’ and other crimes,
  Which Superstition and imperfect Man
  Have hitherto upheld and countenanced,
  Will cease to be and our fair Erth become
  That which Perfection shall attain for Man,
  An Eden Garden, one in fact, not myth,
  A world where love and kindness shall hold sway.
  Thus shalt thou toil towards that far off goal.
  Vergli, my son, be just, be merciful,
  Treat every living thing that breathes and feels
  As kith and kin, nor seek to disinherit
  That living life of Life’s fair heritage,
  Nor filch from Life its dearest privilege,
  The right to live and to enjoy its own.
  Work to make Man divine <i>in heart and form</i>,
  Teach him that beauty is assured to all
  Who shall be born of well selected mates.
  Teach him that ’tis <i>a crime to the unborn</i>
  To breed <i>unhealthy</i> offspring <i>or oppress</i>
  Woman with childbirth’s <i>oft-recurring strain</i>.
  Quality, not Quantity, should be the aim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>  <i>And every child should be the fruit of love,
  And not of lust, incontinence or greed</i>,
  Which latter is ungoverned Passion’s child.
  Vergli, my son, these are thy Mother’s words,
  The mother who has lived and nurtured thee.
  Thou wilt be true, I feel it, for I know
  Thou art in truth born of my very bone.
  See Evening fades. Upon horizon’s face
  Soft lights are dying, slowly, as I die;
  Dying, but only to be born again
  As all is born anew in Nature’s arms.
  Behind the fading evening, darksome Night
  Looms like a ghost, and yet a fair-faced wraith.
  Around whom brilliant worlds irradiate
  And glorify the endless Universe.
  Behind dark Night I see the face of Dawn,
  Dawn, dimpled-cheeked and rosy like a child,
  Dawn that proclaims the birth of a new day,
  The offspring of Eternal Evolution.
  There is no end, Vergli, there is <i>no end</i>,
  Who dares to say the infinite can die?
  Science? Ah: Science, quit your A. B. C.
  <i>And learn to read until you find the Truth</i>.
  Vergli, dear Son, thy Mother sinks to sleep
  <i>Good night</i>, but some day it will be good morning.
  Kiss me, Merani’s eyes are courting sleep,
  The Sleep which Death awards to everyone.
  The Sleep which <i>must</i> awake, as certainly
  As cycle wheel goes ever turning round.
  Bury me, Vergli, where the wild flow’rs bloom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>  Kill not a single bud to deck my grave;
  No faded wreaths let any man lay there.
  Let Nature only whisper with soft voice

<h3 class='c012'>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A large Meeting Hall in Stairway, densely filled with
people. The election of a member, for that district,
to the House of Privilege, is over, the votes have
been counted, and Vergli, to the intense surprise of
<i>the party</i>, influenced by Sanctimonious, the Ardrigh
of Saxscober, and which has hitherto been the
paramount power in Stairway, has been declared
to be the returned candidate. The crowded meeting
is awaiting his arrival, to hear an address from him.</p>

<p class='c009'>[Enter Vergli, Scrutus, Verita, Maxim and Members
of Vergli’s Election Committee. He receives an
immense ovation. The chair is taken by Verita,
who, on silence being obtained, rises and introduces
the new Member of Privilege for Stairway in the
following speech:</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Verita.</i> “Friends; Right has triumphed. Vergli is returned.
  The Cause of Progress, Human love and Truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>  Has made another bound, and left behind
  The prison ground wherein it was confined.
  For what does Vergli’s advent here portend?
  Why, that the voice of Reason shall be heard,
  Not trembling in the slums, or whispering
  In muffled accents its convincing words;
  But ringing through the House of Privilege,
  Echoing in the Chamber of the <i>Bores</i>,
  Re-echoing in the press and through our land,
  Filling the brains of Men with new-born thought,
  Thought, recreated from a vanished past,
  Whose sombre clouds are hastening away,
  And with them the dark ages which they clothed.
  <i>Now</i> have the people won their voice a place,
  And soon that voice, falling from Vergli’s lips,
  Will cry aloud the human rights of Man,
  Which term, of course, includes the Woman too.
  Vergli is Woman’s friend, undoubtedly.
  His creed does not coerce her with its weight,
  No Saulite dictum soils his honest lips,
  To him the human rights are not controlled
  By that <i>inhuman</i> thief, Sex Privilege.
  His mission here is to assist the weak,
  To lift the suffering from out the mire,
  To give to all a chance of Happiness.
  To see appalling Contrasts shall not live,
  To order Labour to protect itself,
  And Capital to share with Labour’s toil
  The golden grain accruing from the two,
  Instead of fabricating Millionaires.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><i>A Voice.</i> “Fat-stomached monsters! Greedy Cormorants!”</p>

<div class='c011'>[<i>Cheers and laughter.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Verita.</i> “You wrong the Cormorant! <i>He</i> fills his pouch,
  To satiate hunger legitimate.
  ‘Fat-stomached Misshapes!’ <i>That</i>, I grant they are,
  Sinners, beside which all the lordly Bores,
  Are saints immaculate and preferable.
  Toil is ennobling, ease contemptible,
  ‘Away with such!’ That is our Vergli’s cry.
  But let him speak. We’ll listen to his voice,
  Hearken to accents that we love so well.
  I yield to our new representative,
  One who is such in deed, as well as name.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli</i> (rising). “Comrades, my thanks to you of either sex,
  My cordial gratitude for all your toil,
  Which has resulted in a victory.
  Nor can I pass from Gratitude’s fond side,
  Till I have bidden her seek that of one,
  Whose heart is with us, though it beats behind
  The gilded barrier of Palace walls.
  Ye know that dauntless spirit, nameless here,
  Nameless, because its mention would entail
  Suffering on one, whose name our hearts revere.
                                [<i>Murmurs of assent.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>  And yet one other I would speak of, too.
  One, who since last ye fondly greeted me,
  Has sunk to sleep in Nature’s kind embrace;
  My Mother, Merani, who taught Vergli
  To make the Cause of all who suffer woe,
  His own. To save the disinherited,
  And preach the Gospel of Fair Play and Truth.
                                [<i>Murmurs of assent.</i>
  The Gospel of Fair Play means equal laws,
  And equal opportunities to all,
  Women and Men, to live an honoured life,
  To toil, <i>but reap the fruits of honest toil</i>.
  Fair Play demands <i>that men who sow shall reap</i>,
  Not toil to bolster up a selfish Log!
  For instance, let us take as an example
  Two men of Property. One owns a mill,
  The other owns a coal mine. Both pay well.
  How should these owners work their properties?
  Is not the wages system a mistake?
  Would not Co-operation simplify
  And bind together owner, workman, all?
  Let him who owns and those who work, receive
  Their fair division of the profits reaped.
  The owner gives the land and the machines
  To work the raw material, yielding gain.
  Let this be calculated as his toil,
  And grain, <i>proportionate to such</i>, bestowed,
  While those, whose labour has produced the grain,
  Receive their fair share of the profits too.
  Thus all would have an interest in the work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>  And feel they laboured not, nor toiled in vain.
  Strikes and disputes would fade like restless dreams,
  And Brotherhood would knit the hearts of men.
  Fair Play demands that money for the State
  Shall be collected, so that all shall pay,
  And pay in due proportion to their means,
  Allowance given for the right to live.
  He who earns just sufficient for his needs
  Should not be asked to give his daily bread,
  But all who profit by their toil should yield
  Unto the State their equitable share;
  Commodities required in daily life,
  And necessary to the weal of Man,
  Should not be taxable, but free as air,
  And luxuries alone be charged upon.
  Fair Play demands that Squalor shall not be,
  That bread and wholesome food shall be Man’s due,
  That able-bodied persons shall not loaf,
  That none shall be denied the right to work,
  That habitations must be fit abodes,
  Not dens of Misery and Pestilence,
  That cruelty to man or to the brute
  Shall be a most severely punished Crime,
  For Cruelty to anything that feels
  Is Crime undoubtedly. We have no right,
  No right, I say, and say it solemnly,
  To mete out pain to any sentient thing.
  The Gospel of Fair Play demands this. Hark!
  Comrades, its far-famed tenets sound aloud
  ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ ‘Be merciful, be just,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>  ‘Do unto others what ye would have done
  Unto yourselves.’ These are Fair Play’s commands.
  He who would reap the grain of Happiness
  Must sow as he would reap. <i>He must be just.</i>
  And now I would point out that Truth derides,
  Derides with scorn all priestly superstition.
  If priests would be, they <i>must</i> adhere to Truth,
  They must not seek to bolster up a lie.
  Truth only dwells in Nature. She abides
  With her sole God, the endless Universe.
  Go, seek her there, and not in fairy tales,
  Proclaim her as she is, not cloaked in sham.
  Truth is a meteor leading on to more,
  Leading to where abounding knowledge reigns.
  Where Truth is not, Falsehood alone can be.
  Comrades, I pray ye, give your hearts to Truth
  And let your reasoning be drilled by her.
  Laws or Religions founded on a lie
  Cannot be good, nay more, they are pernicious.
  Laws born of Truth must be what men should frame.
  I go to struggle to attain this end.
  Now, let me map a programme and a creed,
  Both of which shall be our unerring guide,
  And which shall ultimately Freedom win
  And give to all the disinherited
  That which is theirs, their own, their simple right,
  The right of all things living to enjoy
  And to preserve their lives in Comfort’s arms.
  But first take in the fact that Human Life,
  And much of brute creation can exist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>  And is intended to exist on grain,
  On fruit, on vegetables, likewise herbs,
  And not upon the bleeding, tortured flesh
  Of animals, <i>bred</i> for immoral use,
  As such flesh-eating is, when Nature’s laws
  Proclaim Man and a part of brute Creation
  Intended to be non-carnivorous.
  <i>I urge this point upon you.</i> All around
  Land bids you live upon her wholesome fruit.
  Throughout the world the <i>natural food</i> of Man
  Teems in unbounded wealth awaiting him.
  Let him put forth his hand, and pluck, and eat.
  <i>Rememb’ring always also Moderation.</i>
  Kill not for food, and where Necessity
  Demands the sacrifice of sentient life,
  Kill with all kindness and with due regard
  To Physical—and Mental—feelings. Pain
  Is a nerve-racking, dread experience,
  Especially unto the dumb Creation,
  Who cannot question, yet are forced to bear
  That dread experience, all unwillingly.
  Our programme then must be to fashion laws
  Akin to Nature for the people’s good,
  To overturn the thief, Sex Privilege,
  To make all property, when worked by toil
  Co-operative in the profits shared,
  <i>And land, the birthright of the Human race</i>.
  Wealth must remember what its duties are,
  And never hoard its substance greedily.
  Taxation must be regulated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>  Far juster and more equitable laws
  Than now prevail. Justice must reign, and though
  Equality can never be until
  All men are perfect, we must have a care
  That ghastly contrasts are impossible.
  To Woman give all reverence. Hark! ye, Men,
  The crime of Prostitution, is a crime
  In Vergli’s eyes worse than foul murder’s act.
  Woman and Man were born to be together,
  But Nature’s tie should bind the two as one.
  It is <i>the</i> marriage service, which no creed
  Should dare to trample on or overturn.
  See here I stand a disinherited,
  <i>I am the</i> Prince of Scota, yet denied
  By that false creed of Sanctimonious,
  The right to call myself legitimate.
  By that same creed my mother was condemned
  And called a Prostitute, while Isola,
  Who did not wish to wed my father, holds
  The empty title of a Consort Queen
  And stands by him his legal prostitute.
  Oh! hideous travesty of Nature’s law,
  Oh! hateful doctrine of a priestly creed.
  Call it not God’s, for Nature cries it Shame!
  And Nature is alone the real, true God.
  So now I leave ye bent on Evolution.
  Men have declared us Revolutionists,
  Not so, we are but Evolutionists,
  Evolving Order out of Chaos, and
  Creating where Creation is required.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>  Let us be true unto our principles,
  Come weal, come woe, stick to them everyone,
  And if we work and practise what we preach,
  Assuredly shall Victory be ours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Amidst a scene of intense enthusiasm, Vergli declares the meeting at an end and leaves the hall with his supporters.</i></p>

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Palace of Dreaming, in the city of Infantlonia.
King Hector and Sanctimonious, Ardrigh of
Saxscober, are seated alone in the King’s Audience
Chamber. It is the afternoon of a June day.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious</i> (earnestly).
  “Sire, he is dangerous to Church and State,
  He seeks to fling defiance at us both;
  He would o’erturn our laws and ancient faith,
  And he possesses much the rabble’s love.
  This last concoction, called Humanity,
  Dares to exalt and glorify his name,
  And cast opprobrium on my saintly self,
  Because I represent the ancient creed—
  The creed I learnt upon my mother’s knee,
  From nurse and tutor, pastor and divine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>  Until at length I grew to think it true.
  Of course between us, Sire, and these four walls,
  I do not <i>now</i> believe it <i>honestly</i>,
  Nor more than you do, Sire, or anyone,
  Who thinks the matter out. Ne’erless ’tis best
  To steadfastly proclaim its sanctity,
  And force its worship on our youth and men,
  Especially our women folk, for these
  Are Church’s most devoted friends. Its foes
  Are more amongst the men, and yet methinks
  Queen Isola has opened Woman’s eyes
  To a degree disastrous, dangerous.
  Sire, I would pray your august Majesty
  To lay your strict commands upon the Queen
  That she abstain and instantly from this.
  Her precepts are the Evolutionists’.
  My chief of Peerers secretly reports,
  That Isola devotes her privy purse
  To bolster up these revolutionaries.
  I warn you, Sire, their principles will sap
  The privileges of the Church and State,
  And tumble them about our startled forms.
  Though Vergli is your son, he bastard is,
  But strenuously resists this law of ours.
  And now he has a powerful ally,
  Who will support him in the House of Bores,
  Isola’s brother, Prince of Bernia.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector</i> (starting).
  “What Bernia dead? <i>What</i> Sanctimonious?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><i>Sanctimonious.</i> “So says the Chief of Peerers, Sire, to-day,
  He bore me secret news. Fear not, ere long
  It will be quite officially confirmed.
  Shafto is now the Prince of Bernia,
  An evolutionist in heart and soul,
  Spit of Isola and of self-same mood,
  Indomitable and outspoken too.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector</i> (smiling sadly).
  “And honest I suppose, but as you say
  This is not part of your concocted creed,
  Whose tenets we <i>must</i> own, though in our hearts
  We scorn them and the lie they bolster up.
  My part is one most difficult to play,
  I would be honest, yet may not be so.
  The <i>in</i>fluence of poor, dead Merani
  Surrounds my soul and whispers in my heart.
  Merani dead? If so, her spirit lives,
  For day and night I hear it whispering,
  It tells me to be fair and to be just,
  To clear her name of that <i>un</i>just reproach,
  Which falsely termed <i>religious</i> laws ordain
  Shall be hurled at the Woman who declines
  To take the marriage vows ordained by them.
  And in my heart, Ardrigh, I must confess
  I look on Merani as my true wife,
  And Vergli as the rightful, royal heir.
  Isola did not love me. All her heart
  Was given to the noble Escanior.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>  Yet Arco, Prince of Bernia, her stern sire,
  Slew him and forced her to become my Queen.
  But in my heart, and in your own you know
  That she is nothing but a prostitute,
  A slave, leased to me by unnatural laws
  Whom I dishonour, calling her <i>my wife</i>!
  And now I must coerce her to obey!
  You call on me to bid this toy of mine,
  This royalized and legalized machine,
  This Queen in name, but not in deed, this slave!
  To bend her neck and bow to bearing rein,
  That cruel goad and foe of Nature’s form,
  Nature, so fair when undeformed by man.
  ’Tis a hard part to play, Ardrigh, indeed.
  My humblest subject need not envy me,
  I’d rather far be honest yokel man
  Than a false Monarch of Saxscober land.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious.</i> “Sentiment, Sire; nothing but sentiment.
  Monarchs must not allow so soft a thing
  To take possession of their hearts. You reign.
  You are a King, and being such, <i>must</i> rule
  And shape your conduct by Saxscober’s laws.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector.</i> “A sorry fate to have been born a King,
  Or rather, I should say, ‘the shade of one!’
  My dullest Bores may vote, but I am mute,
  The gilded Puppet of a huge machine!
  Isola is my slave, but I am worse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>  I am the slave of an Automaton.
  But lo! I hear Isola’s voice outside,
  She comes to tell me of fierce Arco’s death,
  And of her brother Shafto’s accession,
  What——”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious</i> (rising hurriedly). “Excuse the interruption, Sire, the Queen
  Loves not the presence of the Chief Ardrigh;
  Her tongue is cutting, though ’tis courteous,
  And I would fain escape its moral sting.
  With your permission, Sire, I will retire
  Through the aperture or the secret door,
  Which leads from here into the private room,
  Where you conduct your personal affairs,
  And correspondence intimate. But, Sire,
  Remember to admonish Isola,
  Bear in your mind that you are still <i>The King</i>,
  And sink all individuality;
  Be true to Church and State, uphold their laws,
  And force the Queen to humbly bow to them.”</p>

<div class='c011'>[<i>He retires hurriedly through the secret door.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Enter Isola</i>, saying:
  “Hector, I thought old Sanctimonious
  Filled up the Audience Chamber’s narrow space;
  Is he not here? Whither has he vanished?
  Into that Heaven, where I am denied
  The right of entry, being Infidel?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>  Or has he gone to Purgatory, where
  Repentant souls are burning off their sins?
  Or—dare I say it, Hector? To that Hell,
  Which God, <i>the God of Sanctimonious</i>,
  Has made to torture wicked infidels,
  And all such carrion, though of his Creation?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Hector</i> (sternly):
  “Isola, thou art over bold. Conform,
  And yield respect to our religious faith.
  What matters it if thou art infidel,
  And worship Nature’s God? Thou art my Queen,
  My Consort, my annointed property,
  My Co-mate on the throne of Saxscober.
  Now, understand that thou art this indeed,
  And <i>must</i>, as Queen, obey the laws of Church,
  As well as those of State. Defy me not.
  By those same laws I am thy master, girl,
  And will enforce submission. Yield it now.
  Goad me not to Coercion. I would fain
  Reign with thee peacefully and happily.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola</i> (passionately).
  “Hector, by an opponent law of Truth,
  I am your queen and slave, a consort queen,
  A gilded, dressed-up slave, not reigning, Sire,
  But just a sort of bauble, like a crown,
  A State-kept mother of your progeny,
  Each one of whom is given right to reign
  According to succession, while I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>  Declared to be a cast off ‘Dowager’!
  Is this right, Hector? No, ’tis infamy.
  A consort’s fate is pitiable indeed,
  Whatever be the sex of the Misshape,
  But of the two, the female one is most,
  Because Maternal rights are not her own.
  Mind you not, Hector, of that male consort,
  Of Queen Magenta, Prince of Citron called?
  <i>He</i> would not be <i>her</i> gilded bauble sire,
  But shared with her the right to reign as King,
  As I should share that right with you indeed,
  Were I your lawful Queen and wedded wife,
  And you my lawful mate, which I deny,
  Because by Nature’s law, poor Merani,
  Before you stole me from my Escanior,
  Was your true Queen, and Vergli your true heir,
  She having lived with you as wife, although
  She would not take those <i>church-made</i> marriage vows,
  Born of the creed preached by the great Saint Saul!
  Nor did you ask her to, because by law
  E’en had she wedded you by Saint Saul’s creed,
  A rotten civil law denies to her
  The right to take the title of the Queen.
  Because she was not a princess before
  She mated with you! Out on all such laws!
  Fruits of a creed the child of Selfishness,
  Mated with ill-omened Superstition.
  No, Hector; Isola will not conform,
  She treats with scorn such laws of Church and State,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>  Nature’s true laws alone will she obey,
  She will not own a creed which is a lie,
  She will not practise laws which are unjust;
  Your slave she is, but most unwillingly.
  She casts defiance on unnatural law,
  Isola is an ‘Evolutionist’—”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Hector</i> (aside).
  “And I, too, in a way; for although reared
  And dosed with selfish and ignoble tenets,
  <i>Deep in my heart</i> I <i>feel</i> Isola <i>right</i>,
  And that her dauntless spirit pleads for this.
  <i>She</i> is <i>not</i> Man’s opponent, <i>but his friend</i>,
  His <i>true</i> Co-mate, loving Companion,
  Who only asks of him Justice and Truth.
  Oh! sorry fate, that I must strive with her,
  And force submission where ’tis now withheld.
  Yet must I do so. ’Tis my Kingly fate
  To be a tyrant and to act the Sham.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>To Isola.</i> “Isola, cease thy sentimental moans,
  Our age demands not feeling, but a Show;
  Give it a pageant, be it royal Pomp,
  Or a procession of dressed-up divines,
  And it will cheer them lustily and long.
  I am a ruling Puppet, thou my Queen,
  Our business is to play our sep’rate roles,
  I as the Public’s slave, and thou as mine.
  It is the Law and Custom of our land;
  We are bound by them. Them we must obey.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>(Pauses and then continues):
  “Understand this. Thou must obey our laws,
  Both civil and ecclesiastical.
  Thou must not be an Evolutionist,
  Thou must be what thou art, my <i>Consort Queen</i>.
  And play thy part upon the royal stage.
  Defy me not, Isola, bear in mind
  I am thy King, thy Master <i>by the law</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola</i> (defiantly).
  “No need to tell me, for I know it well.
  But I defy you, Hector, and your law.
  A fig for all such false authority.
  I never sought to be your slave, nor asked
  To dangle at your side a bauble toy.
  Do as you will, but <i>I</i> will <i>not</i> conform,
  Nor bow to sham conventionality.
  Arco is dead, Shafto is Bernia’s prince,
  Let me return to Bernia’s hills and dales,

</div>

<p class='c013'>A rambling Castle, situated high up on the hillside of
Rostraveen Mountain, overlooking the Lakes of
Killareen. It is the Castle of Killareen, the Highland
home of the Princes of Bernia. Shafto, Prince
of that name, is at this time occupying it, and from
his eyrie stronghold has defied the orders of his liege
lord and King, to yield up to the latter, Isola, who
has fled from Saxa Isle and claimed the protection
of her brother, in consequence of having refused to
act the part of a Consort Queen to King Hector, or
to acknowledge her child by him as the Prince of
Scota, averring that Vergli is the rightful heir.
She has refused to act the part of Queen Consort
on the principle that no reigning rights are attached
to the dignity making of her a mere nonentity,
such a principle being contrary to the Evolutionary
principles of the Evolutionist Party, of which Vergli,
Member of Privilege for Stairway, is the leader,
Isola being a member thereof. Divorce proceedings
have, in consequence, been commenced against her.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola</i> (leaning on the stone parapet of the Castle ramparts, overlooking the lakes below, sings to herself):
  “Is there a fate on ev’ry life

  Is there a bosom free from strife?

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “Vulnar, your voice is beautiful and rare,
  Where is the heart to whom you sing these words?
  Oh! yes, the bond of love is Heaven’s tie,
  Yet, when ’tis snapped, Hell’s chasms yawn below.
  ’Tis a fair world, and all might be so gay,
  Laughter and song, playing with gentle love,
  Were it not for bad laws and customs vile,
  And evil teaching meted out to youth.
  How happy had my lot been but for these.
  Nature gave me a birthright passing fair,
  First Life, then health, the power to love and feel,
  The opportunity to taste of each.
  Had Nature had her way, my path all strewn
  With fragrant flow’rs, would have been smooth indeed!
  But human selfishness makes mock of Truth,
  And rules life with one endless, searing lie.
  Thus it swooped down upon Isola’s path
  And makes the way, indeed, all stones and crags.
  Your song is sweet, Vulnar, but mine <i>more true</i>,
  I simply sang of stern reality.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span><i>Vulnar.</i> “Lady Isola, Hector claims divorce,
  And, doubtless, will obtain it speedily.
  Thus will the laws which bind you as his wife,
  Release you from the union you abhor.
  Freedom will then be yours. Ah! may I hope
  That you will love Vulnar as he loves you?
  Lady Isola, I have loved you long,
  Loved you all secretly, more than my life,
  Loved you since I was but a boy in years,
  Loved you in silence when Escanior
  Found favour in your eyes and won your heart.
  He was my friend, and your joy my whole life.
  I would not try to steal your love from him.
  But he is gone, passed to the Great Unknown,
  Passed o’er the boundless Ocean of Life’s space.
  Whither? Who knows? Beyond our mortal ken.
  Will you not try to give Vulnar your love?
  He would not force it on you, Isola,
  But be content to wait and hope for it.
  At any rate, his whole love would be yours,
  His heart no other Woman’s property.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “Kind Vulnar, <i>Nature’s Nobleman</i> indeed.
  Ah! if such as you ask for were but there,
  It would go forth from my poor heart to you.
  But, Vulnar, what you seek no longer hides
  Its coy head in Life’s throbbing mechanism.
  Isola’s heart held love for one alone,
  That love went roving with Escanior,
  When the cold dagger drove him from the side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>  Of Isola beneath the Ocean wave.
  I cannot give you what is mine no more,
  Vulnar, ’tis gone. It is with Escanior,
  Wedded with his, all indissoluble,
  Part of his being, as his was of mine.
  His love lives with me, ’tis imperishable;
  ’Twill guide me to the Great Unknown some day,
  There to unite with my own love again.
  Vulnar, your heart so noble and so kind
  Will understand and feel with Isola.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Lady Isola, if the love I seek
  Has passed away to rove with Escanior,
  Will you not give Vulnar the right he craves,
  The right to love you and to live for you?
  He will not ask for that which cannot be,
  Nor would he steal such love from Escanior,
  But give him just the right to care for you,
  To be with you through Life’s lone Pilgrimage.
  Ah! do not drive me from your side, I pray,
  I only ask to be with you. No more.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “No, Vulnar, ’tis impossible, I say;
  <i>To mate where love is not is Hell enough</i>,
  But then at least, indifference can dull
  And make one callous and like frigid stone.
  But <i>no true Woman</i> could <i>treat thus</i>, a man
  So noble and so kind as you, Vulnar.
  Men such as you are not so numerous,
  Hearts such as yours are jewels scarce and rare.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>  Isola would not wrong you as you ask;
  No, Vulnar, seek a fitter mate than me.
  And yet, if you will give her Friendship’s aid,
  She’ll cherish it as the most precious gift
  Which Vulnar’s Generosity can give,
  The dearest treasure left to her on earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “’Tis yours, Isola, given heart and soul,
  Nothing you asked of me could I refuse;
  At least I ask but one return for it,
  It is that, though you cannot love Vulnar,
  He may be licensed to love Isola,
  All silently as in the past he’s loved,
  Loved with a love he feels can never die,
  A love which, unobtrusive, yet shall stand
  The test of time, faithful unto the end.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “Brave heart, so tender and so true, pure soul,
  If gratitude for love so infinite
  Will give you solace, then indeed ’tis yours,
  Isola’s heart <i>is</i> grateful to Vulnar.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Enter the Prince of Bernia, exclaiming</i>:
  “What, Vulnar here?
  Vulnar, news just to hand apprises me
  That Vergli is arrested, charged with Crime,
  The Crime, conspiring against Church and State.
  ’Twas in the House of Privilege he cast
  Defiance at their laws and pleaded hard
  For a reform of both, which he declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>  Must be both sweeping and far-reaching too.
  The overturning of his Labour Bill—
  Wherein Co-operation is enforced
  Upon employers who amass large hoards,
  By taking all the profits of men’s toil,
  Giving but wages in return, instead
  Of that which is the toiler’s rightful due,
  A share of Toil’s returns—aroused his ire.
  Because, I’m told when this same Bill was lost,
  Defeated by a large majority,
  The sneers and jeers, and cheers which hailed the fall
  Of his much-cherished infant, maddened him.
  He rose, and in impassioned accents, hurled
  The vials of his wrath on Church and State,
  So that men shouted ‘Treason!’ Wonder reigned,
  And all agape, demanded his arrest.
  This has been done, and Vergli is in gaol,
  A bad look-out for Evolutionism.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “’Tis that, indeed, a cause has oft been lost

  And closing lips that told it how to act.

  And fell from them in show’rs of sparkling rain.
  He said they were Merani’s whisperings,
  A Woman’s voice, of which his was the echo;
  I doubt it not, believing, as I do
  That Woman, disinherited by laws
  As false as they are wrong and execrable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>  Has Mission, greater than to be a slave,
  That Mission to be Man’s true comforter
  By guiding him along the path of Truth,
  Not grovelling and fawning at his feet.
  Let her rise up and speak aloud that Truth,
  Let her assault base Superstition’s lie;
  ’Tis Superstition which has made her slave,

<h3 class='c012'>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A small room, sparsely furnished, in the Prison of
Grillaway. The room is the cell of a first class
misdemeanant. The windows are barred and look
out on to exercising ground, which is surrounded
by high walls. The cell in question is that of
Vergli, who is confined therein.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli, Solus</i>:
  “Saxscober a free country? No, indeed!
  A slave of mummified and ancient laws,
  Created by the undeveloped brains
  Of men emerging from the feudal state.
  Must Evolutionism be controlled
  By relics of a past barbaric age,
  When human beings had no right to think
  And fashioned rules to suit their daily needs?
  What right have dead men to control us now?
  Must we be governed by their narrow vision?
  Shall rotten laws be solely the support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>  Of an increasing substance, whose new needs
  Require the nourishment of true reform?
  Oh! prison bars, ye gaolers mute and dumb,
  Guess ye the torture which consumes my soul,
  Longing for freedom, longing for the pow’r
  To strike to earth Injustice and Untruth,
  And raise upon their ruins fairer scenes?
  Alas! for Evolutionism, who
  Will keep our party solid? Who will lead,
  Now I am a caged pris’ner in this hole?
  Scrutus and Verita will do their best,
  Good faithful hearts, yet lacking influence,
  And minus that great pow’r which can enthuse
  And weld together diff’rent characters.
  Well, I must seek to use the pow’r of Thought,
  And draw towards me that which my heart loves,
  Isola, can I make thee think of me?
  Can I enthuse thee to take Vergli’s place?
  The people love thee, thou can’st lead them well,
  If thou wilt take the lead, I have no fear.
  Isola, thou whom this lone heart adores,
  Although thou can’st not love me in return,
  Thy heart being wedded to Escanior,
  Wilt thou not fill the place I cannot fill?
  See, I will waft to thee intense desire,
  And by the force of thought fill up thy soul
  With the ambitions influencing me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He seats himself as he speaks, and leaning his head in his hand, seeks to attract Isola to think of him and<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span> take up his cause by stepping into the breach which he has been forced to abandon. Suddenly he looks up, and intense relief is in his face as he exclaims:
  “A great calm fills my soul. I seem to hear
  The whisper of an inward voice, which says:
  ‘Vergli, fear not, Isola fills the breach
  And will uphold your cause till you are free.’
  Is it a dream or glad reality?
  I feel it is the latter. As my thought
  Has sped into the mind of Isola,
  So has hers come to mine and brought me cheer,
  And filled my spirit with intense relief.
  Oh! Thought so wonderful, which has evolved
  A mind from matter and, endowed with life
  By this same matter, can magnetic-like
  Attract to us flashes of hidden things,
  As thou increasest in us, wilt thou not
  Vibrate into us knowledge now unknown,
  Knowledge of space and of infinity,
  Of what has been, and of what is to be,
  By some attractive force whose law is vague
  And still quite undeveloped in our minds,
  Yet, all the same, a law as positive
  As that great law which rules the Universe?
  If this attractive law can magnetise
  Mind unto mind, will it not magnetise
  Those hidden facts which, still unknown, ne’erless
  Are facts which Thought will some day penetrate
  And draw into our minds, thus fashioning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>  A knowledge now unrealised, unknown.
  Yes, mighty, <i>energetic, living Force</i>—
  Give it what name you will, it matters not—
  Thy pow’r will wax so great within our brains
  As to attract to us that which we seek.
  As Thought meets Thought, or draws it from afar,
  As I have drawn the thought of Isola,
  So shall this unseen, veiled, but true reality
  Conquer the secrets of the Universe
  And give Materialists the light they need.
  Develop it, all <i>scientific</i> men!
  It is as much a substance, though unseen,
  As any of the unseen substances
  Which influence Creation’s mighty laws.
  Have you not studied much those things we see,
  And drawn conclusions from the truths unveiled?
  Go, study now the Unseen, cultivate
  That undeveloped faculty, whose sight
  <i>Will</i> penetrate the mysteries of Life
  And open up the mists enshrouding death.
  Oh! learned men, how unlearned yet ye are.
  ‘What! Thought a substance?’ sneeringly you ask.
  ‘I think it is,’ all humbly I reply,
  ‘It is a thing which, though unseen, vibrates
  With delicate pulsation all its own.
  Thought is the substance which shall solve the past
  And open wide the future to our eyes.’
  Yes, Isola, my soul no longer fears,
  I feel that thou, attracted by this force,
  Wilt do as I desire and do it well.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>  A woman who has buried Superstition
  And scorned to make herself the slave of Man,
  Albeit she is his loving friend and mate,
  Can lead and will lead on Humanity
  To win its freedom, and to recreate
  Noble conditions, elevating all
  By evolutionary principles.
  I feel thy answer to my mute appeal
  Circling around me like a soft, soft wind,
  Caressing with kind kiss my anxious brain
  And soothing it as sleep lulls tired thought.
  For thought being real and not imaginary,
  A substance not a shadow, form unseen
  Of ethereal property, <i>can</i> tire and hang
  Limp and all unemotional at times,
  Or dulled by over-use of its great pow’r
  Which sleep and rest restore unfailingly.
  My thanks Isola. From afar thy thoughts
  Have come to cheer me in my prison cell,
  My soul’s at peace. I hear thy whispered words
  ‘I come, Vergli, fear not, All shall be well.’”</p>

  Methinks if we paid by results, the Clique
  Known as solicitors and barristers
  Would find their present lucrative profession,
  Somewhat the contrary! ‘No fish; no pay,’
  Would make these gentlemen a bit more keen

  Of one of these noteworthy gentlemen,
  To pick his pocket so to line his own!
  However, here he comes. I will attend

  In a few days your trial will take place,
  Counsel is offered by the Government;
  Your grave Solicitor refused, howe’er,
  And said that ‘<i>Vergli would defend himself</i>.’
  I just think that he will, and rightly, too;
  For one speech from his lips is worth ten score
  Of speeches from the windbags of the bar,
  Who set much store upon their oratory—
  Pricing it highly, changing briefs to gold
  And turning inside out their clients’ pockets.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli</i> (laughing):
  “’Tis true, young clerk. Society’s odd ways
  Are manifold; but, all drift down the tide
  Whereon the bark of Might o’er-rides poor Right
  Seated in her frail skiff, and runs her down.
  ‘Out of my Way!’ cries Might. ‘Am I not large?
  Are you not frail and of no consequence?
  The weak should die, the strong alone prevail
  And Might rule over Right.’ This is the law,
  Or rather as it is administered.
  And how can it be ever otherwise,
  Until to Earth we strike the selfish creed,
  Which prating loud a few great Moral Truths,
  Forthwith defies them, and sets up a reign
  Of Superstition and of Mummery?

  Although I fear nothing will clear your crime;
  The Ardrigh knows acquittal means his doom,
  And ev’ry influence which he commands
  Will be exerted to o’erthrow your cause
  And bolster up his own. Alas! I fear
  That nothing will avert your punishment.
  Think, Vergli, of the Pow’rs that you oppose,
  Think of the forces all arrayed in line
  Ready to crush you to the earth, to kill.
  ’Tis an unequal fight. Oh! Vergli, pause!
  Think of the future, think of liberty,
  Think of the horrid doom which will be yours.

<p class='c013'>A small villa standing in a pretty garden, surrounded
by a high wall, in a quiet part of the suburbs of
Elsington, and not far from the public gardens and

in the villa, seated at an escritoire, is Isola. She is
no longer Queen of the Saxscober people, King
Hector having obtained a divorce; and she is
secretly engaged in carrying on the evolutionary
agitation of which Vergli, before his arrest, was the
leader. It is the day of his trial on a charge of
conspiring against the Church and State laws of
the Kingdom of Saxscober. Isola is dressed in male

  So still sat silence on the list’ning crowd.
  Truly he rose unto the great occasion

with folded arms, unfolds them and bows his head
slightly in assent. The hum of voices in the Court,
which had broken out when the foreman of the jury
had uttered the word “Guilty,” at once subsides
and a great silence falls as Vergli begins to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “Reason to give against my murder? Yes.
  For Murder it will be assuredly.
  What right have you to take from me God’s breath,
  Because I seek to see His laws prevail?
  What is my crime? To have demanded Truth?
  Truth in religion in the place of Sham?
  Yes, I have asked for that and pleaded, too,
  For a vast Revolution in the laws.
  I claim to be King Hector’s eldest son,
  The heir apparent to the Monarchy;
  I am the Prince of Scota, Prince Bernis
  By Natural law is not the King’s wife’s son.
  I claim that my dear Mother was that wife,
  I claim that she with Hector should have reigned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>  Reigned as a reigning not a Consort Queen;
  I claim the parents’ right, <i>of either sex</i>,
  To reign before their children. Out on laws
  Which make a <i>child usurp its Mother’s place</i>,
  Or, if a female be an elder child,
  Ousts her from heirship on account of sex!
  Imbecile law! Worthy of priestly craft,
  Worthy of Superstition and Saint Saul,
  Of men bedridden with such mistresses
  As are these soulless and unnatural laws.
  All law is bad which Nature has not framed,
  Be it of Civil or Religious sex,
  And all Religion is a cursèd lie
  Whose God is otherwise than Nature’s form.
  Away with your man-shaped and cruel God,
  In whose own image you declare you’re made,
  Faith! He must be an ugly Barbary Ape,
  If the majority of men reflect
  His Godlike features in their ill-formed masks.
  But here I fling to Earth the Monster creed
  With which you mystify our early years,
  Distort our reason, warp our faculties;
  And make that fatal transformation scene
  In Human character, which would be kind
  And sensible and brotherly in love,
  Were it not for the Orthodox tirade
  That moulds it with false teachings and precepts
  Throughput the whole of Life’s sad Pilgrimage.
  What right have you to make of Life a hell?
  To disinherit men of their just rights?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>  Follow out Nature. To the fittest give
  The right to lead, to rule, to fashion law.
  The fittest should survive, the unfit pass
  Into the force that can evolve anew
  A better Life from Mediocrity.
  Men should not starve while others feast and laugh.
  By what Almighty Law of Nature’s God
  Do men step into Life outcasts and slaves?
  Why? Yes, why? I ask; for Opportunity
  Is Man’s inherent right. Sex should not be
  The disability you’ve made of it.
  Give all an equal opportunity,
  The fittest will arise and lead and rule,
  And make this world a heaven where now ’tis hell.
  Let all men work from Monarch to workman,
  Let all reap benefit from honest toil.
  Let Life be made Co-operative and
  See to it that Injustice shall be slain.
  Build up a new religion based on Love,
  Away with Cruelty to Man <i>or Beast</i>;
  Beasts have their rights just every much as Man,
  Are they not our own kin, our mute, dumb friends?
  We have no right to torture them for sport,
  For Scientific purposes or food.
  Blood was not made for Man’s consumption. Grain
  And fruit, and vegetables, and nuts and herbs
  Are what God Nature gives him for his food;
  And Health demands he should adopt as such.
  Give us a kind religion. Let the Truth
  Be the magnetic influence of our lives.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>  Let Sham and Superstition be condemned
  As false and hideous idols of the past.
  Down with all law in Church and State which kills
  The holy rights of Nature, our <i>true God</i>.
  Oh! Woman, wake! Crush the black snake Untruth.
  Wake! Woman, wake! And you shall wake the <i>World</i>.
  Are these the sentiments which merit death?”
            [<i>Cries of</i> “No! No!” <i>and</i> “Yes! Yes!”
  “Should they not rather live eternally?
  Are they not <i>true</i>? Is not all Truth divine?
  What! Treason is it to condemn a lie?
  What made the lie? God? No. Just little Man.
  Man, still in an imperfect, undrilled state.
  Shall lies or laws based on them be immortal?
  Not so, I say. They must be executed.
  Vergli will be their executioner.
  Is he a Revolutionist? No, no.
  He is an Evolutionist. That’s all.
  Kill him? You cannot! Thought will <i>never</i> die,
  <i>It is a part of Immortality</i>.
  Silence this body? That which gives it life
  You cannot kill, because it is of God.
  It is that which is speaking to you now.
  Silence it? Never! ’Tis eternal Life.
  For <i>Thought is Life</i> and Life which cannot die,
  It is the Soul and deathless part of Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>[He ceases speaking. Loud applause breaks out which
is with difficulty suppressed. The judge assumes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the Black Cap and pronounces the death sentence.
It is received in contemptuous silence by Vergli
and gloomy silence in the Court.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the prisoner is led away, <i>Verita</i> manages to pass near him and whispers:
  “Hist! Vergli! Isola is all prepared.
  Fear not! Ere long thou shalt be free as air.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE IV.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A quiet side street in the City of Infantlonia, leading
from the crowded thoroughfare of <i>Rolling Motion</i>
to that of <i>Drifting Tide</i>. Off this side street runs
a mews, the stables lining one side thereof, and a
long wall facing them the other. This wall encloses
a garden, lying at the back of an unpretentious
house looking into the quiet street. It has been
purchased by Vulnar, Lord of Avenamore, in the
principality of Bernia; and is occupied by one
Fortunatus, the youthful leader of the Evolutionist
Party.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span><i>Fortunatus</i> (entering the garden from a room on the ground floor):
  “Time’s dragging slowly. Scrutus should be here
  To tell us what the verdict is. Methinks
  ’Twill be one quite in keeping with the faith
  Which cries aloud ‘Judge not,’ and yet condemns
  Unceasingly all those who mock at it.
  Vergli <i>will be</i> condemned. Of course he will,
  Or I have much misjudged the character
  Of the fierce opposition of that clique
  Called ‘Church and State,’ which rules our destinies.
  Vergli will be condemned. A gibbet tree
  Will be the offering of barbarism—
  That ugly child, offspring of Superstition,
  Who crushes thought and dulls the intellect,
  Degrades the Woman and deforms the Man.
  Man who might be so noble, but for it.
  Let them condemn you, Vergli. Have no fear,
  We’ll save you, Prince of Scota. Escanior
  Loved you, Vergli; Isola loves you too,
  Because Escanior loved you, and because
  You will not trample Woman to the ground
  And bid her hearken to the great Saint Saul.
  You know her degradation is Man’s shame.
  You scout the orders of Most Holy Church.
  You advocate Fair Play to all Mankind,
  Mercy and tenderness unto the brute.
  You are a Man, as every Man should be—
  Brave, without fear, yet tender, loving, kind.
  Vergli, e’en if I feared the hand of Death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>  I’d grasp it eagerly to set you free.
  Let them condemn you. Freedom shall be yours,
  E’en though I lose thereby Sweet Liberty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A shrill whistle sounds in the street. Isola quickly
draws one of these from her breast pocket and blows
a clear note upon it, then passes rapidly through a
door leading from the garden into the mews. The
movement of many men’s feet can be heard therein.
From afar a rumbling sound is heard, and the
rapid trot of horses sends its echoes ahead. In the
mews stand Vulnar and Fortunatus. Past them
rushes a wild, eccentric looking man, singing:</p>

<p class='c009'>          “The Canyons are coming,
            They are not afar,
          The pigeons are homing,
            Go forth to the war,
          Strike hard for the freedom
            Of God’s noble son;
          They’d give him a cold tomb,
            We’ll give him Life’s Sun.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar</i> (in a low voice):
  “Ready, men! Ready! Hold yourselves alert!
  Hark! ’tis the rumble of the prison wheels.
  Make ready to rush forth at the first sign
  From Fortunatus. Watch his every move,
  You know the signal. Steady! Vergli’s life
  Hangs in the balance. All depends on you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>  Hark! It comes nearer, that revolving sound,
  That rumbling and that rapid, ringing trot,
  Hush now; all eyes on Fortunatus! Hush-sh-sh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunatus, standing near the entrance to the mews,
looks round suddenly, and drops a handkerchief.
Instantly a score or more of men rush out into the
street. A prison van, surrounded by mounted
police, comes by at a rapid trot. The head of every
horse is seized, and revolvers held pointed at their
riders, others emptying the holsters of their captives.
Vulnar, Scrutus, and Fortunatus make straight for
the door of the van and demand, from the policeman
inside, admittance. He refuses.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Then, stand back, man, care for your life, have care!
  We’ll fire and smash the lock. Here, Volio, boy,
  Fire through the keyhole; quick, no time to lose,
  So ho! well done, you’ve shivered it in two.
  Open the door. Be quick. Vergli, art there?
  God bless thee, Vergli; we’d all die for thee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Vergli is hurried into the mews by Vulnar, Fortunatus
and Scrutus, and disappears from sight. At the
same time the reins are taken off the van horses,
and bridles slipped off those of the mounted men.
All is confusion, during which the conspirators, all
of whom are masked, slip away unobserved. Some
time elapses before the rescue becomes known.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Policemen hurry to the spot. The van is entered
and the policeman inside is found to be dead. He
had not taken Vulnar’s warning, and the bullet
which smashed the lock had entered his heart.

some ten years ago.)<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the gilded Chamber of the House of Bores. That
usually empty Chamber is full, and the galleries
around, crowded. The centre of attraction is
Bernia’s Prince, Shafto, who has entered the lists
in defence of his feudatory subject, Vulnar, lord of
Avenamore, who has been attained of high treason,
for aiding and abetting the rescue of Vergli.—Vulnar
and Vergli are at large, as also Fortunatus.
Against all three a warrant for arrest is out.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>The Prince of Bernia</i>:
  “Is it a crime to speak the truth? Methinks
  We live amidst a sea of seething lies,
  Wallowing therein like the proverbial whale,
  Who with a guzzle, down which e’en a prawn
  Is passed with difficulty, swallowed up,
  Miraculously, of course, a tough old seer,
  Who proved, however, indigestible,
  So that the whale emitted him again,
  Unchewed, whole and unmasticated. Oh!
  What lies we wallow in and teach our Youth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>  The whole time crying like a hypocrite,
  ‘Speak not a lie, ’tis an abomination.’
  Just so my Bores, that’s how I class it too,
  And so I’ll speak the Truth just for a change.
  ’Tis rather foreign to these gilded walls,
  But try and give it courteous reception.
  I see His Graciousness the Arch Ardrigh,
  Looking a bit ungracious and severe,
  I pray him don a less depressing mien,
  Religion should incarnate scenes of peace,
  Not war, resentment, animosity!
  Now to my subject. You condemn Vulnar,
  Lord of the boreship of fair Avenamore,
  Attaint him traitor to our lord the King,
  Because he rescued from a cruel death
  The King’s own son, bone of his very bone.
  You dub him and young Fortunatus, too,
  Murd’rers, assassins. How so? Did they plan
  Murder or assassination either?
  Not so. But while engaged in rescuing
  The prisoner from the van, unluckily,
  A bullet, fired by some conspiritor,
  Into the key lock, having done its work,
  Passed on and most unfortunately lodged
  Within the heart of the policeman Grett,
  Killing him as a natural consequence.
  For this you call these men foul murderers,
  If they be such then soldiers are assassins.
  <i>Malice aforethought surely is alone
  The only sculptor of the murderer?</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>  You bid me bar my principality
  Against Vulnar, and Fortunatus too,
  And war against them as state enemies.
  But I assert they are not such, but friends,
  Faithful to Hector, our liege lord and King.
  My bores, I know Vergli; his soul is high
  He simply works for Justice and for Truth,
  He advocates fair play to every man,
  To every living, moving, sentient thing.
  His creed is, ‘Follow Nature, It is God,
  Inscrutable, but not impossible.’
  The God to whom you offer sacrifice
  And before whom you kneel like hypocrites,
  Is an impossible, a defamed God,
  A brazen serpent reared aloft by Man,
  Dyspeptic Man, who dreamed a nightmare dream,
  And forthwith called it the Almighty God!
  Almighty lie! I call it, yes, my bores,
  Lie of Nightmare and of Indigestion.
  Vergli would purge our stomachs of this lie,
  And heal the wounds its foul disease has wrought.
  Bring peace on earth and goodwill to the world.
  <i>Why</i> should we live to kill, and to oppress?
  Why should a small majority laugh loud,
  Wrapped in the lap of luxury and ease,
  While the majority lives in trouble
  And writhes within the arms of poverty?
  Why should I wear fine clothes and eat good food,
  My brother in the street wear rags and starve?
  Vergli would end this, and moreover give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>  To Woman the inherent rights she claims,
  <i>Which your dyspeptic creed has filched from her</i>,
  Making of her the puppet that she is.
  Vergli claims to be Prince of Scota too,
  He says that Merani was Hector’s wife.
  Nature, the One, true God, declares this too.
  Is Vergli wrong for clinging to the Right?
  My bores, I, Shafto, Prince of Bernia, cry,
  He is not wrong. He is the soul of truth,
  The soul of honour and of equity,
  The enemy of Selfish Privilege.
  He does not ask for the impossible,
  He does not prate of Man’s equality,
  He is not of the Anarchist brigade
  Whose <i>muddle puddle</i> laws would chaos breed.
  He simply asks that <i>all</i> men born should live,
  And have <i>the opportunity</i> to thrive,
  And <i>not be born</i> the disinherited.
  Just pause a moment. <i>Let us think.</i> Suppose,
  Just for the sake of argument I pray,
  That when we die, our Soul, which I believe
  Is out of matter forming Mind and Thought,
  Should peradventure take possession of
  A life in an embryo state, and step
  Either into this sphere, or say, elsewhere.
  Would you not like to think that soul of yours
  Will not become the tenant of a slave,
  A Disinherited, a Misery,
  But rather a free mortal born to live
  And make the most of Nature’s Gift of Life?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>  Remember, ‘every mongrel has its day,’
  If Life is as I say, you may become
  One of the disinherited of Erth.
  Or of that distant planet we call ‘Light,’
  And who, perhaps, calls us ‘The Moon.’ Just now,
  A whisper in my ear says its real name
  Is Earth, and that our Erth is called ‘The Moon’
  By this same Earth whom we have christened ‘Light.’
  That whisper is a thought, a solid touch,
  Which woos my mind, making its presence felt.
  E’en as a soft wind plays upon my cheek,
  Telling me that it is a <i>thing</i> of Life,
  Although invisible to that thick mass,
  That shape Material or Body called,
  Which is the Tabernacle of the Mind,
  And of that ethereal substance known as thought,
  That loadstone which shall draw truths Unknown,
  Once we develop perfect tenements,
  Worthy of <i>Thought increased a millionfold,
  With power to read the past, the future, All</i>,
  And fathom what to our embryo minds
  Is now a veiled and hidden mystery.
  My bores, Vergli and Vulnar you condemn,
  And youthful Fortunatus likewise stands,
  Marked as an object for the hangman’s rope.
  Would you commit so terrible <i>a crime</i>
  As to deprive those three of Nature’s breath,
  For acts which <i>are not crimes</i>? Pause, think, my bores,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>  Are they deserving of a death so drear?
  I pray you, join your signatures to mine,
  Ay, every member of The House of Bores,
  Entreating the King’s Gracious Majesty
  To pardon and accord fair Liberty
  To Vergli, Fortunatus, and Vulnar.
  They are not felons; two are noble men,
  One, a brave youth, full of enthusiasm.
  Treat them no more as disinheriteds,
  But as three loyal subjects of our King.
  My bores, I, Prince of Bernia, sue for them:
  Most earnestly I pray you grant my prayer.”</p>

  And treason likewise to Most Holy Church,
  Vulnar and Fortunatus are condemned
  By that great voice, Public Opinion, called;
  My bores, away with Sentiment, face Fact.
  What are the facts justly condemning them?
  Vergli has sought to overturn the State,
  And sweep our Church away. Absolutely!
  ’Tis treason to our Sovereign lord, the King.
  He is the head of both our Church and State.
  Treason demands the penalty of Death,
  And Vergli stood condemned of this foul crime,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>  And sentenced to the punishment it merits.
  When Vulnar, Fortunatus, and some more
  Defied the law and rescued him from death,
  Dealing death to another in the act.
  The blood of Grett is on their hands and heads,
  He died a brave man in the cause of duty.
  These rebels shot him down. They murdered him.
  They took his life that Vergli’s might be saved.

  The awful fiend of Revolution lives,
  Scotched, but not killed. Vergli would overturn
  Not only Church and State, but revered law,
  Make free of other people’s property,
  Turn Woman into Man, and make men Slaves,
  Abolish wages, crown Co-operation.
  Think what his wild schemes would impose on us.
  Think how the Millionaire would suffer, too?
  Co-operation! Why, ’twould give all men

  What call you this, my bores, but Spoilation,

  Would mean surrender to dishonesty.
  And that <i>the least</i>. Behold! our noble Church,
  A relic of the ancient days of old,
  Part of a great <i>tradition</i> threatened now.
  It is the fabric of Morality,
  And all the notions that we love and cherish.
  True, it has not opposed the fiend of War,
  And it has dabbled over much in blood;
  But these are peccadilloes. Wink at them!
  We must not show up Godly indiscretions.
  So, too, it is a most important fact
  That men <i>must</i> toil, that other men may reap,
  That animals <i>must</i> moan, that we may laugh.
  To seek to overthrow these saintly laws,

  Would mean destruction of the principle,
  ‘Might is our Right,’ which we laboriously
  Have made an Axiom of, and <i>must</i> uphold.
  No, no, my bores, Stand to your guns. Be firm.
  You have the press and nation at your back.

  The Brotherhood of Man is dreadful fudge,
  The God of Nature far too practical.

  The House of Common persons has declined

  It is its bounden duty to the State,

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A rugged glen in the Highlands of Scota. The glen
forms portion of a pass, lying between two high
hills, respectively called Cairnghlu and Dhugla,
which dominates this pass, known by the name of
“The Pass Ghlugla.” A rapid torrent threads its
way through the valley below, passage through
which is only possible by the pass above. In a
large cave in this pass, attended by a few faithful
followers, Vergli, Isola, and Vulnar, together with
Scrutus and Verita, have concealed themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>their adherents guarding both entrances to the pass.
News has been brought that two large forces of
militia have been sent to apprehend them, one
advancing from either side.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli</i> (solus, standing at the Cave’s entrance):
  “’Tis a strange life! We cross its threshold first,
  With little understanding in our brains.
  Then suddenly, into that empty Cave
  Steps an immortal soul, which we call Thought,
  Turning the empty cave into a Mind.
  From that mind, Thought is ever issuing,
  In ripples, like a calm, pellucid sea,
  Or in tumultuous waves of reasoning,
  Diffusing all around its magic spell.
  Some brains receive but little of this thought,
  While others are o’er-charged with its great force,
  And magnetise the weaker brains of men,
  Who yield obedience to the stronger pow’r.
  Is it this pow’r which gives me followers,
  Willing to risk their fortunes for my sake?
  Or are my principles the motive force
  Which causes them to fight for Vergli’s cause?
  A bit of both, I fancy. Still, I think
  It is the thought pow’r that attracts them most,
  A glance from me, accompanied by a thought
  Silently wished within my active brain,
  Will often gain for me that which I seek,
  Without recourse to <i>viva voce</i> speech.
  Ah! well; If Thought <i>can</i> concentrate itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>  In force sufficient to attract success,
  I’ll send wave after wave abroad, in quest
  Of kindred and reciprocating thought,
  Which shall respond to my far-reaching call,
  Seemingly soundless and invisible.
  Is my call soundless? Yet ’twill penetrate
  And ring my message in the brains of men.
  Therefore it must have something kin to sound,
  Something in Nature like a zephyr sprite,
  Whose wings float round us, yet we hear them not,
  Whose lips caress us, though we see them not,
  Spirits we feel, but cannot hear or see,
  Life living, yet in form invisible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pauses, then continues:
  “Oh! come to me, Success, ye whom I woo,
  <i>Not that success</i> for which Men strive so much.
  Not empty adulation and renown.
  I care as little for the world’s false praise
  As I care for its paltry condemnation.
  The true Success I ask to come to me,
  Is that the Truth, whose flag I hold aloft,
  And Justice and kind Love shall triumph o’er
  The reign of Falsehood, Cruelty, and Hate.
  For this I send forth thought waves far and wide,
  May their returning tide bring back to me
  My bride, Success, whom I court from afar.
  Yes, she will come. I feel it. She <i>will</i> come,
  Although across an angry, tossing sea.”
                [<i>Looking up at the summit of Dhugla he apostrophises it.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>  “Summit of Dhugla, Peak of misty clouds,
  Around whose brow the golden eagles soar,
  Upon whose breast the sentient form of Life,
  Called animal Creation, finds support;
  Like unto me thou soarest heavenwards,
  With glance fixed on the guide Excelsior,
  Whose hand points ever upwards, bidding us
  Pierce Space unending, and Immortal Truth.
  Summit of Dhugla, as thou wooest Heav’n,

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Vergli, the enemy are closing in,
  Our scouts apprise me of their near approach.
  To try and hold this pass against such odds
  Would be a folly; tactical mistake,
  And blunder irretrievable indeed.
  We must disperse, and that without delay;
  The hillmen love you. Whisper of your name
  Assures the wand’rer hospitality.
  Let us, while it is possible, disperse,
  The winter soon will be upon us now,
  These passes quite impassable. Hark! Sir,
  A distant bugle call! Its winding note
  From out Kilsonan’s valley, steals aloft.
  We can, of course, stay here and fight it out,
  Leaving our bodies for the Corbies’ sport;
  Yet killing is not noble Vergli’s aim,
  But Life around which Freedom twines her arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>  Rather his object. Thus I counsel flight,
  <i>Not craven flight</i>, but <i>politic retreat</i>,
  And a reunion midst securer scenes.
  Let us disperse and make for Avenamore,
  There, through the winter, though I am outlawed,
  I’ll guarantee you full security.
  The Men of Avenamore will stand by me.
  Take Scrutus and Arflec, both are experts
  In Scota’s hills and Bernia’s rugged paths,
  And I will steer, with all my craftiest skill,
  A safe course thither both for Verita

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Palace of Magnificence, situated in the town of
Rowanberry, and the residence of the Ardrigh
of Saxscoberland. In the private sanctum of
the Ardrigh two men are seated. One is His
Graciousness himself, the other the head of his
“secret service peerers,” these being a body of
men kept by Sanctimonious for the purpose of
keeping vigilant watch over the interests of the
State Religion of the country. The two men are
engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious.</i> “And so, Conception, from your fertile brain
  You have evolved a plan to lay them low?”
                    [<i>He draws nearer to Conception.</i>
  “While Vergli, Fortunatus, or Vulnar
  Remain at large, destruction threatens us.
  Destroy this trinity and dangerous force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>  Of Will, and thought, and optimistic hope,
  And all will flow serenely once again.
  The torpid languour of the working men
  Will soon return to lull them all to sleep,
  As in the good old days gone by, when I
  Ruled o’er the roost in undisputed sway.
  Now tell me of the plan you have evolved,
  And <i>who</i> the Genius is who’ll take the helm
  And steer its course into the bay Success.
  Tell me, Conception, I am all attention.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Chief Peerer Conception.</i> “Your Graciousness, ’tis nothing new indeed;
  An old, old plan, in origin quite human,
  Just the old story, treachery, ha, ha,
  The counterpart of the malignant Lie,
  That lie which bolsters up the most of Life
  And bids uncanny Truth to hide her head.
  The Genius who will pilot in this case,
  Is one called Judath. In his black lined soul,
  The love of gold is the abiding lust,
  Which rules him to exclusion of aught else.
  I have informed him that the price I set
  On Vergli’s head is twenty thousand crowns,
  On that of Fortunatus, half that sum,
  On Vulnar’s head the half of that again,
  And if the <i>three together</i> he can bag,
  The sum of forty thousand shall be his.
  Your Graciousness, his eyes gleamed like a coal,
  A wolfish, hungry glare arose in them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>  The cunning of the fox leapt from their depths
  And ogled me with side look, amorous glance.
  His yellow teeth grinned at me as he said,
  ‘Sir, I will claim the forty thousand crowns,
  Yea, ’ere the winter snows have clothed the earth,
  They’ll hang before grey cloaked November’s gone,
  And <i>Judath shall have forty thousand crowns</i>.’
  Your Graciousness, had you but heard his voice,
  And seen his face, and looked into his eyes,
  You would have felt, as I felt, ‘All is well.’
  Have I done well? The job’s a bit high priced,
  But worth the coin, I think, your Graciousness.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious.</i> “Worth it, Conception? Rather! Double! More!
  The peril threatened is of magnitude,
  And forty thousand is the minimum
  Which I would pay to see it rooted up.
  Just think what Disestablishment would mean,
  A mine of wealth let loose amongst the mob;
  Vergli would have that wealth distributed
  And sunk in his Co-operative scheme
  For giving every toiler a part share,
  According to his toil, of the State funds.
  His heathen propaganda would destroy
  Not only emoluments, but instal
  Amongst the public free-lance teaching, and
  Abolish that most necessary vice
  Called prostitution, which is the result
  Of both our civil and religious laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>  The first safeguarding it as politic,
  The latter in accordance with the faith
  Held by our creed that Woman is that thing
  Which I’ve heard termed the ‘After-Birth of Man,’
  But which I’d rather call God’s ‘After Thought,’
  Or ‘Second Thought,’ creation from a rib!
  Man being fashioned in the shape of God,
  Is naturally <i>the</i> Superior Life,
  And Woman, but a bauble After Thought,
  Made for Man’s Comfort, and his Pleasure too,
  Is of no consequence, except as slave,
  As wife obedient, or as prostitute.
  And Vergli dares to say we preach a lie,
  And strives to waken Woman to the truth,
  Proclaiming her Man’s equal, shouting out
  She is not part of Man’s Almighty rib!
  Conception, just conceive the blasphemy!
  Conception, realize the rolling wave
  Of unbelief, which will o’erspread the land,
  Once Woman takes to heart that this is true.
  Great Scot! She’ll sweep us off our noble legs,
  She’ll cast the Saintly Rib into the fire,
  Cremate it on the instant without Shame,
  And dare to ask for Equal Rights with Man.
  What should we do? Alack! What should we do?
  Man’s infidelity we can despise,
  So long as Woman grovels in Belief,
  But if <i>she</i> cease the Stomach Crawling farce,
  We are undone! Alas! we are undone!
  And so, Conception, forty thousand crowns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>  Is not too much to pay to kill this snake,
  This awful offspring of the Satan myth,
  Which we invented to uphold the slur
  Cast on the Woman by our Holy Creed.
  No, at all costs, keep <i>sight</i> from Woman’s eyes,
  Once she obtains it, like a cataract
  Will fall on us her wild and angry wrath,
  Sweeping away the Fable of the past,
  Which we have held aloft six thousand years,
  Moulding from it our creed, our faith, our laws,
  And forcing Man to hail it as Divine.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Conception.</i> “True. Woman sleeps. She knows not of her pow’r,
  That pow’r which would make her a ‘Woman Free.’
  <i>And those who would awake her must be slain,
  For they are deadly enemies to us.</i>
  Vergli <i>is</i> dangerous, and Isola
  As dangerous as he is, of a certain.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious</i> (contemptuously):

  She’s pining far away in Killareen.
  The outcast of our King, divorced from him,
  Denied access e’en to her little child,
  Prince Bernis, Prince of Scota, Hector’s heir.
  She is of no account, her name is dead,
  Bernia’s dishonoured Princess! in good sooth.
  She scorned me, bit at me, questioned my right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>  To sit upon the freedom of her sex.
  I think I’ve taught her just a <i>little</i> lesson!”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Conception.</i> “Your Graciousness is over-confident.
  Listen, but keep it secret from our King.
  The youth, upon whose head a price is set,
  Young Fortunatus, is this Isola.
  Ha! Ha! You start, turn pale, and look distressed,
  Small wonder, for you know Isola’s heart,
  You know it is undaunted, brave, and warm,
  A combination irresistible.
  She has concealed identity from all,
  Successfully hoodwinked the populace,
  And leads as <i>Fortunatus the Unknown</i>.
  It is my business to assist this blind,
  King Hector would not hang <i>his</i> Isola!
  He loves her, though she was so coy to him,
  Mourning for that Adonis, Escanior,
  Friend of her childhood and her budding years,
  And then her lover, love which she returned.
  King Hector would not harm her. As you know,
  In spite of long sojourn with Merani,
  Isola’s presence fascinated him,
  Double her age. He might have been her sire,
  She held him an admirer, ne’er-the-less,
  Although his love repelled her. Escanior
  Being the only idol she adored.
  So ‘Mum’s’ the word, your Graciousness. Keep dark
  That Fortunatus is fair Isola.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>  The former is the hangman’s property,

  Than sign a Warrant sanctioning <i>her</i> death.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sanctimonious.</i> “Fear not, Conception, I will not betray,

  So <i>you</i> defy me still, young Isola,
  <i>You</i> still make sport of Sanctimonious?

<p class='c013'>The royal Castle of Belmadhu in Scota. King Hector

hills. Close to him his little son Bernis, Prince of
Scota, is playing. The King is reading a letter from
Isola.</p>

(Reads aloud)
  “Let me speak to you, Hector. I <i>will</i> speak.
  You must and shall do justice to Vergli,
  You must and shall acknowledge him as heir,
  You must and shall honour Merani’s name,
  You must and shall teach Bernis to be true,
  Each day I’ll send this message to you, King,
  Until it takes possession of your heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>  And though I am no longer nigh to speak,
  I’ll cry it to you daily from afar.
  And this, too, will I cry each day be sure—
  You shall not always be a puppet King,
  But lead your people and your Government
  To do away with antiquated law,
  And cast aside a false and senseless creed,
  Which bolsters up innumerable wrongs
  And rushes in the face of Evolution.
  Hector, you must give freedom to Vulnar,
  He has a noble soul a kindly heart.
  What is his crime? He freed your son from death.
  He is an outlaw for that reason, King,
  You shall not punish him who saved your son.
  You shall cast off your shackles and be just,
  You shall not teach our child to be a thief,
  Or act a lie, or filch his brother’s name.
  Bernis, of course, <i>by law</i> is yours, Hector;
  A <i>man</i>-made law gives him to you not me,
  But Nature’s law declares that he is mine
  Far beyond yours. Yes, Bernis is <i>my</i> child.
  I did not want him. He was forced on me.
  I did not marry you of my free will.
  They killed Escanior and you purchased me
  To be your <i>law</i> wife, Church-blessed chattel slave.
  But all this cannot alter the great fact
  That Bernis is our child and, though by law
  You take him and deny my right to him,
  I am his Mother. Yes, he is my child
  By an inexorable sacred law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>  Which man-made laws may flout but cannot kill;
  And so I tell you, Hector, guard the child,
  Make him what Isola would have made him.
  I do not <i>plead</i> with you I say <i>you shall</i>,
  You shall bring up my child as I desire.
  Yes, you may smile and scoff at Isola,
  Think you <i>she</i> cannot read your inmost heart?
  Deep down therein <i>there is</i> a fount of love
  Which royal schooling has both checked and plugged,
  But which is bubbling at its source ne’erless.
  It shall o’ercome your royal slavery
  And make you a just Ruler, not a tool.
  Thus, Hector, shall I speak to you each day,
  You’ll hear my voice whisp’ring around your brain
  And fear not they shall find an entrance there.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Hector</i> (laying the letter down):
  “Isola, thy words are ever whispering,
  They haunt my mind at all and every hour.
  Undoubtedly I loved you, Merani,
  And by God’s law you were my wife, indeed;
  And Vergli <i>is</i> the Prince of Scota, too.
  But I was reared <i>not</i> to think in this way,
  And so I did not know the crime I did,
  When I bought Isola, yes, bought that girl,
  And raised her up my puppet, Consort Queen.
  Poor Merani forgive me. Dead days rise
  And come again from out that vanished past
  When we were lovers, and for love of me,
  You braved the world’s cold scorn and stood by me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>  My Nature-wedded wife, faithful and true,
  Loving and helpful, yet too proud to swear
  The senseless formula prescribed by law,
  Which ordered you to swear to be my slave.
  Yet were we man and wife by register,
  Which took our promise to be man and wife,
  And married us before the God of Heav’n.
  Then State expediency tore me away
  And gave me a girl wife, unwilling bride,
  Who loved another and denied me love—
  Yet whom the law gave me as lawful Queen.
  I loved Isola, Merani forgive;
  I could not help it. Yet <i>she</i> wronged you not.
  She always spoke of you with true respect
  And said <i>you were</i> my wife, she but a slave.
  Then you went forward. After that she bowed
  To Natural law and called herself my wife.
  But her proud spirit would not brook restraint,
  Nor act the puppet part of Consort Queen.
  When I and Sanctimonious sought to force
  This part undignified upon her, she
  Left me and sought the refuge of her home.
  I claimed her back, but Bernia’s Prince refused
  To yield his sister up; and so our Church
  And State divorced her, made her an outcast
  And left, of course, the child to be my care.
  Merani, you so kind, with heart so large,
  Will understand and will forgive the King.
  Oh! sorry fate. How long must I sham on?
  How long must I approve what I detest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>  And be a slave? What! sign my son’s death warrant?
  Never! I will not murder my own child.
  Thank goodness he escaped, and yet, alas!
  If they should catch young Fortunatus and
  Arrest Vulnar, the law will hang these men
  As murderers of the policeman Grett;
  And I shall sign approving warrant, I,
  The father of Vergli whose life they saved.
  Was ever man more sorely tried than I?
  Oh! sorry, sorry fate to be a King.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Enter Larrar</i>:
  “Sire, there is most important news arrived.”
(Reads)
  “‘Three masterly arrests have just been made—
  Of Vulnar, Scrutus and young Fortunatus.
  One of their followers turned traitor and
  Betrayed the hiding place where Vergli lurked.
  Young Fortunatus, though entrapped himself,
  Managed to send a warning to Vergli;
  He and Vulnar and Scrutus stood their ground
  And held the entrance to their chief’s retreat.
  Fearing that Vergli would refuse to fly
  And leave the others to their fate, the youth
  Resorted to a subterfuge, saying
  Vergli must meet them on the Bawn co Pagh,
  Whither they were retiring. He knew well
  That once on Bawn co Pagh, the citadel
  And fortress of Vulnar, Vergli was safe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>  And midst a band of men true to his cause;
  But for this cunning message here detailed,
  Vergli would have returned to aid his friends
  And been entrapped and made a prisoner.
  E’en as it was the others might have fled,
  But had they done so would have doomed Vergli;
  And so they fought it out and thus gained time,
  But were at length o’ercome and captive made.’
  The name of him who worked this clever ruse
  By which this mountain hiding place was found,
  Is Judath, who feigned fealty to their cause
  But turned informer and betrayed them all.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector</i> (aside):
  “Curses upon him. Black-souled son of Hell,
  Monster of foul and base iniquity.”
(To Larrar)
  “So, so, they’ve caught the three who murdered Grett;
  Now will the law avenge itself, the mob
  Wreak its all-fathomless resentment on
  The men whom Judath has so deftly nailed.
  And I, yes I, must bow with smothered love
  Crying within my bosom to my soul,
  And sign the rights of these men to fair life
  Away into the black abyss of wrong.
  Larrar, what piteous fate e’er made me King?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Larrar.</i> “Not fate, Sire. You can cast the title off
  And just become an ordinary man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>  Children like dolls, the grown-up child likewise
  Makes you its doll and pays you for your trouble.
  What are you, Sire, but the paid servant of
  A government of nondescript creation?
  You do its work and call yourself a King.
  I am your servant, but you in your turn
  Are mine, because I am part of that state
  Which pays the piper to pipe forth <i>its tune</i>.
  Vergli would have the King part of the State,
  The chairman, so to say, one with real pow’r.
  Paid, but a real King, not a mere cypher
  To whom men bow, although but to a slave.
  Were you a real King you could speak your mind
  And guide your peers and people to be fair,
  Or influence them to espouse the right.
  I say not Kings should be all absolute,
  But they should be Chairmen of the State.
  At least this is the creed preached by Vergli
  And long ago his words converted me,
  I am at heart an Evolutionist.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector</i> (aside):
  “And I, too. <i>Who</i> would be the farce I am?”
(To Larrar)
  “Larrar, you are presuming. Have a care,
  Kings’ <i>waiting-men</i> are servants, too, you know;
  A waiting groom and waiting lord are paid.
  If I’m a puppet, all who wait on me
  Are puppets, too! What shall we call the thing
  Which this queer puppet-mixture has evolved?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>  Merry-go-round or Humbug spinning round?
  I think the latter, ’tis more suitable;
  For Humbug is in the ascendant now
  And Sham the Idol of Society,
  And over all King Hector spreads his wings;
  Shall they be free wings or their pinioned stumps?”</p>

  Vulnar likewise and faithful Scrutus, too?
  Condemned to die for giving me my life!

  And give it, from them, to posterity.
  Vergli, live to reward their sacrifice,
  Live to see triumph—that for which they’ll die
  I know I echo dear Isola’s thoughts,
  Do you not feel them hov’ring round you now?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “Yes, they steal round me, gently kissing me,
  Bidding me be a hero not a cur.
  Dearest Isola, I shall work for you
  And win the Right we both desire so much.
  To go to you, to die by your dear side,
  That is <i>the wish</i> of Vergli’s yearning heart;
  To live for you, to win the Truth you love,
  Shall be <i>the duty</i> done for you and Right.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Verita.</i> “Spoken as heroes speak, noble Vergli,
  Your answ’ring words will cheer Isola’s heart;
  They’ll flood with light her prison’s lonely cell
  And bring her happiness and restful peace.
  Now will I start for Infantlonia. There!
  The sun is sinking, all is red <i>and gold</i>,
  The colours flood the far off western sky.
  Red is Blood’s sign, but Gold’s the sign of Truth,
  And Martyr’s blood <i>shall</i> win Truth’s victory.”</p>

  Thou art not dead. Thy life is with me now.
  I am thyself, I am thy property.

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the exercising ground of the Prison of Holdfast.
Vulnar, Fortunatus and Scrutus are at exercise.
The first two have halted and are engaged in conversation.
It is the day before their trial.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “This I assume is the <i>last</i> chance I’ll have
  To speak to you, Isola. Without doubt
  The verdict will be Guilty, sentence Death.
  My lawyer tells me that the angry wave
  Of that most fickle Judge, Public Opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>  Is rabid for our instant execution!
  We are, in fact, condemned before being tried;
  A wave of anger has possessed the land,
  Fostered, encouraged by the powers that be.
  Ah! well, t’will soon be o’er. I fear not death,
  To die beside you is enough for me.
  Vulnar asks not a better fate, indeed,
  But to be faithful to the very end—
  To Love, to Justice and to mighty Truth,
  All three the seraphs of a perfect Life.
  Forgive me, Isola, for breathing love,
  But I <i>have</i> loved you faithfully and well.
  To feel you feel this and forgive Vulnar,
  Would make his last days peaceful and content.
  He could not help his love, it came on him
  Long long ago when he was yet a boy;
  He loved this love and hugged it very tight,
  And nurtured it, until it grew so strong
  He knew no mortal pow’r could sever it;
  The sapling had become, in fact, an oak—
  An oak impervious to ev’ry storm.
  Kind Isola, I know that you forgive
  And do not blame Vulnar for loving you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Isola.</i> “Why do men love me thus? What is the spell
  Which makes them love with such unselfish love?
  Oh! Vulnar, could I blame <i>you</i> for such love?
  Rather, I thank you for your brave devotion.
  Kind Vulnar, loving friend of Escanior,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>  ’Tis good, indeed, to have so true a friend;
  If it to you is joy to have loved me,
  Believe me, ’tis a joy to me, Vulnar.
  I would not sell your love for all the world;
  I would not barter it for Life itself.
  Such love in man is so uncommon, rare,
  To own a gem so rare is wealth, indeed.
  Yes, Death is nigh, that death men fear so much.
  Why do they fear it, if their God is good?
  Why fear to go to what is loving, kind?
  If God is as a father, they should laugh
  And clap with joy their hands at sight of Death.
  This they do not, but fear it fearfully.
  Why? Because they have made an untrue heav’n;
  A cruel hell, a hydra-headed God
  Whom they call Good and yet fear to approach,
  Whom they adore and yet seek to evade!
  Small wonder seeing they are human and
  This God is most inhuman. Oh! fair Truth
  Prevail, prevail, come quickly and prevail.
  Well, Vulnar, Life is fair and Life is Life—
  To us who know that Thought can never die
  And is the soul of Life, we fear not Death;
  Because we feel ’tis but an open door
  Where Life rejoins the Thought which cannot die,
  And starts afresh upon Life’s pilgrimage.
  I will not say farewell, we’ll meet again,
  You and my fair-haired, blue-eyed Escanior;
  We’ll meet, our forceful thought attracting us
  To be together. Yes, to be, to be.”</p>

  This Thought, which now inhabiting my brain

  These are they ‘Be you just and merciful,
  Become a king in <i>deed</i> rather than name,
  Work <i>with</i> your people and for them, Hector;
  Let King mean brother, treat all men as such.
  Sweep from the statute book all useless law,
  All law which harrows progress, or degrades.
  See to it that the young shall learn the Truth,
  Learn to be useful, moral, just and <i>kind</i>—
  To give to every living thing that breathes
  The right which Nature gives it, Happiness.
  Train up the youth to say “Thou shalt not kill,”
  To say it <i>and to practise it as well</i>.
  Abolish War and raise up Arbitration.
  See that each child is taught a trade, or shewn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>  How to use hands given for work and use.
  See that all men have opportunity
  To work and win the fruits of honest toil.
  Let all work be Co-operative and
  Give unto woman what you give to man.
  Let principles of Fair Play animate
  All laws and regulations of the State;
  Let Reason guide their framing, not the lust
  Of gold, or greed, or selfishness. <i>Be fair.</i>
  Let it be ordered “<i>Privilege shall die,
  Just laws alone rule o’er the Destinies
  Of Man and beast.</i>” Crush Cruelty to earth.
  See to it that <i>the base, ignoble crime</i>
  Cursed Vivisection, be swept <i>clean</i> away—
  <i>Totally</i> abolished, treated <i>as a crime</i>,
  And stains no more the fame of our dear land.’
  One last word, Hector. Watch o’er our Bernis,
  Make him a hero not a bauble prince;
  Let him be what Isola bore him for,
  To be an honest and an upright man.
  And with this last word let me bid you rise
  And call unto your side your first-born son,
  Give him the right to be that which <i>he is</i>—

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><i>A tremendous roar is heard outside. The words</i>

<p class='c009'><i>The Hangman.</i> “Dead, Sire! The word ‘reprieve’ reached me too late,
  The sound arrived just as I pulled the bolt.
  His last words were ‘Bless thee Hector, Victory!’
  I heard them uttered as he fell below,
  His death was speedy, instantaneous.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Hector</i>, laying both hands on Vulnar’s shoulder and bowing his head on them, sobs out:
  “Isola! Isola! too late! too late!
  Oh! Isola forgive. I rode <i>my</i> best.
  I rode not as a King, <i>but as a man</i>
  Whose heart was bursting to reach you in time.
  I rode the horse you used to love so well.
  The chestnut Saladin. He cleft the air,
  He seemed to fly like arrow from the bow.
  <i>He did his utmost. I did mine.</i> Alas!
  Fate was against us. Fate inexorable.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span><i>The Governor</i> of Holdfast prison exclaiming to himself:
  “Isola! Fortunatus, Isola?

  Haste man! Cut down young Fortunatus. See.
  Quick! bear the body to my private rooms.
  Explain the situation to my wife.
  Tell her to lay Isola on the bed.
  Apprise her that the King is here. The King!
  A pretty pass! A tragedy indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar</i> (to the hangman):
  “Unpinion me and Scrutus. Do it sharp, man.”
                                        [<i>A pause.</i>
Turning to the King and taking his hand:
  “Oh! sire, grieve not, you did your very best.
  Would I had died first, and saved Isola.
  I never dreamed of a reprieve. Brave heart!
  She died to give me life. She died for Truth.
  Sire, see to it she did not die in vain.
  Her last words, ‘Bless thee Hector. Victory!’
  Shall ring into your soul and make you just,
  Oh! yes, they shall. Her name will gain the day,
  Isola dead, <i>shall</i> win bright Victory.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector</i> (still sobbing):
  “Take me to Isola. Isola!
  I tried to save thee, but I came too late.
  I strove with human might to be in time,
  <i>The human heart was beating in my breast</i>.
  All royal mummery had left my side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>  It was <i>the man</i> and not the King that strove,
  Though Kings <i>can</i> feel, <i>they are just human beings</i>,
  Albeit barbaric customs make them dolls.
  And I, I loved thee Isola. <i>I did.</i>
  Who could help loving one so kind, so true?”
(To Vulnar)
  “Vulnar, where is she? Take me to her side,
  I tried to save her, but I came <i>too late</i>.”</p>

<div class='c011'>[<i>Sobs.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar</i> (linking the King’s arm in his and signing to the Governor, standing close by, to lead forward):
  “Come, sire, I’ll take your Majesty to her.
  Take comfort thinking how she blest you, sire;
  Mourn not for her, she died as she had lived,
  With valiant heart beating for others’ woes.
  Death had no terrors for her, sire, indeed,
  It cannot claim the soul of Isola,
  Her deathless Thought, that which made her a pow’r,
  Lives on and will live on eternally.
  Doubtless ’tis roving with Escanior’s,
  She loved him, loved no other all her life,
  I, his old Comrade, testify to this,
  I who e’er worshipped where her feet have trod.
  And yet she’ll hover round you sire again,
  And influence your heart to make the Cause,
  For which she died, triumphant everywhere.
  She claimed to reign with you, see to it Sire
  That her loved voice <i>shall</i> wake this world again.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>They follow the Governor to his private apartments,
and this latter and Vulnar silently stand aside as the
King enters the one in which Isola has been laid.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>King Hector</i> (solus):
  “Yes, she <i>is</i> dead. Isola, thou art gone,
  <i>That which o’ertakes all men</i> has come to thee.
  Vulnar spoke rightly, when he said that thou,
  Dead should ne’erless obtain the Victory.
  Yes, thou hast won it. Here, I swear to thee,
  All thou did’st die for shall be realised,
  Right shall prevail, and <i>Men shall own their own</i>,
  There shall be no more disinherited.
  Saxscober’s Constitution shall become
  The constitution of a people free,
  And I will be their real, not dummy King,
  Their brother worker, their companion.
  While Life is left to me to work, I’ll work,
  I’ll make Saxscoberland a dreamland scene,
  It shall reflect thy dream dear Isola,
  <i>Its face shall be the mirror of thy soul</i>.
  Vergli shall aid me. My first act shall be
  To do him justice and proclaim him heir;
  Our little Bernis shall not act the thief,
  He shall be what thou sought’st to keep the child,
  A human being, not a puppet slave.
  He shall be his brave mother’s substitute,
  In him already shines thy deathless soul.
  Isola, thou hast won, I swear it, <i>Love</i>.
  Thy <i>death has won</i> Saxscober’s Liberty,”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>He bends over and kisses her forehead. Then leaves the room. Meeting Vulnar outside, he says:
  “Vulnar, I leave <i>her body</i> in your care.
  Treat her as you would treat a <i>reigning</i> Queen.
  She shall reign over fair Saxscoberland
  In deed, in fact, in true reality.
  Unto the other nations of our Erth
  Her message shall be borne and shall prevail,
  The bright example of Saxscoberland
  Shall move the smaller fry to imitate,
  A bright example has its magnetism,
  And draws men to solicit its embrace.
  Hector is clasping Isola’s. No force
  Shall ever tear it from his grasp. No fear!
  I leave you, Vulnar. Do your part. I go.
  My share in Evolution has begun.
  With Vergli I will lead its sacred cause,
  With him will realize Isola’s dream.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Is it a dream or Truth’s reality?
  Can it be fact or is it only fancy?
  Isola dead, I living, Scrutus free,
  Vergli no longer outlawed, but our Prince?
  It seems a dream, and yet ’tis not a dream,
  ’Tis true, and Isola has triumphed. Sure!
  My love! my love! Who died to save Vulnar,
  Who died for noble Truth, which he upheld,
  And dying, won Saxscober’s liberty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>  Yes, it is won. Though Opposition strong
  Will struggle to retain the law of Might,
  Right shall prevail, and noble Truth prevail,
  That Right and Truth for which Isola died.”</p>

<p class='c009'>[He beckons Scrutus, who is standing near, to
follow him, and goes out. In the streets
around the prison loud cheers can be heard.
They are given to King Hector, who is driving
away in the Governor’s carriage. So
far, the death of Fortunatus and the fact
that Fortunatus is Isola, has not transpired.
Vulnar interviews the Governor, and makes
every preparation for the removal of Isola’s
body to the residence of her brother, The
Prince of Bernia.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The fortress Castle of Bawn co Pagh. A voice sings:
  “Where Liberty with Love entwines its arms,
  Its Life possesses vast, magnetic charms;
  Cold, lifeless Licence is not liberty,
  To be a King means not that you are free.
  Laws docked of Nature are not Freedom’s joys,
  But just mechanical and puppet toys,
  Laughed at by men, who scorn their puny sway,
  And treat them as just made to disobey.
  ’Tis Love whose occult Pow’r alone conceives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>  What properties makes freedom. She receives
  Into her gentle bosom Truth’s mandate
  And guided by it learns how to create
  Those laws which fashion Liberty divine,
  And which alone from Love’s soft eyes can shine.
  Oh! Love, thou child of the Almighty Pow’r,
  Seductive as the sweetest scented flow’r,
  Thy influence is paramount to save,
  Teaching men to be just, be fair, be brave,
  To be the sons of Liberty and thee,
  True mates who can alone produce the free,
  Those free, whose eyes are fixed on Love’s bright Star,
  Speaking to them in flashes from afar.
  Be thou my guide all through my mortal Life,
  Holding thy hand let me destroy the strife
  Which Cruelty creates and scatters round,
  Sowing its poisoned grain in fertile ground.
  I will, by aid of thee, uproot this grain,
  Upon it Fire’s consuming powers rain,
  Burn it to ashes, sow instead thy seed
  Which shall Love’s golden luscious harvest breed,
  Whose sustenance shall nourish and inspire
  Kindness to triumph over Selfish ire.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli</i> (coming to the ramparts and looking over them):
  “Do my ears mock me? Sure, ’tis Vulnar’s voice,
  None other owns such subtle melody.
  Is it your Spirit serenading me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>  Comrade in arms, friend of my boyhood, too?
  Vulnar, sure voice like yours is quite unique,
  You have no rival, so it must be you.
  You have no equal, whose melodious touch
  Sends through the being thrills of ecstacy.
  Vulnar, where are you? Is your presence nigh,
  In body or in spirit calling me?
  It seems to me as though Isola’s voice
  Whispers unto me, ‘Vergli, Victory,’
  And now I hear song rippling from your lips,
  Song such as Vulnar’s lips alone can frame,
  Song in whose melody, immortal Truth
  Mingles with mortal utterance in tune.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Enter Vulnar</i>:
  “Hail, Prince of Scota. Welcome to my home.
  Welcome, Prince Vergli, to our Bawn co Pagh.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli</i> (seizing his hand):
  “Vulnar alive! Vulnar not dead? Not gone?
  Are my eyes clear, or am I dreaming dreams?
  Vulnar saluting me as Hector’s heir,
  Calling me Prince of Scota? Hark! <i>I</i> hear.
  Whispers are whispering within my brain,
  I hear Isola’s voice addressing me.
  It comes from Vulnar, yet <i>it is her</i> voice.
  ‘Vergli,’ it says, ‘Hail Vict’ry? You are free.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Yes, Vergli, it is Victory indeed.
  From Isola, whom both of us adore,
  I bear you the last word her dear lips framed,
  She died while utt’ring it. ’Twas ‘Victory.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span><i>Vergli.</i> “Isola dead! And you alive, Vulnar?
  Can it be possible? Speak man. Explain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Vulnar recounts events to Vergli. The latter listens in silence, then exclaims:
  “Isola dead. Happy Escanior.
  You revel in a being we have lost.
  Lost, yet not lost, for Isola is nigh.
  Around me is her presence. Ev’rywhere!
  Her Thought permeates my soul, entrancing it,
  The breath of Memory is on my brow,
  Within my brain her voice is speaking Love,
  Love, velvet Love, to Vergli and Vulnar.
  Yes, Vulnar, love to you, and love to me,
  For Isola is Love itself. Her Life
  Was one long act of love. Cold Cruelty
  Was the sole thing she hated on our Erth.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Sir, Diamond Truth falls from inspired lips,
  Your words are echoes of that attribute.
  There was no hate or fear in Isola,
  Save of the awful demon Cruelty,
  And him she feared and hated cordially.
  Her words through Hector, my dear lord, The King,
  I bear you now. ‘Come, take your own, Vergli,
  You are The Prince of Scota, true born son
  Of Noble Merani. Saxscober’s heir.’
  Hail Sir, as such, no <i>courtly</i> homage mine.
  But just acknowledgment of brotherhood,
  There is but one nobility, one claim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>  Which I acknowledge as nobility,
  And that is Merit, child of Perfect Thought,
  That perfect thought which love alone can frame.
  Lo! sinks the sun behind the Bawn co Pagh.
  Amidst a perfect sea of yellow gold,
  Whence shoots aloft a fan of brilliant rays,
  Blue, opal, green and purple in their hues.
  Mark the ascending stream. Is it not fair,
  This portrait of the fireworks of Heaven?
  Is not the scene symbolic of that Thought
  Which sinks in Death only to rise again?”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “’Tis so, for Thought is Life, Eternal Life,
  Soul of the Body, Master of the mind,
  Its eyes look through the eyes of human sight
  And speak their eloquence, fervid though mute,
  There is more meaning in one soulful glance,
  Than reams of words from mere material lips.
  But come, Vulnar. Gladden your people’s hearts,
  They mourn you as amid the gallant dead.
  Rejoicing will awake the Bawn co Pagh
  And ring its echoes over hill and dale.
  I love them well, these hillmen. They are true.
  They’ve treated me as though I were a King,
  And yielded me a kindness exquisite.
  I might have been the lord of Bawn co Pagh,
  Instead of what I was, a hunted thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vulnar.</i> “Sir, you were to them what you are to me,
  The Prince of Scota, though a hunted thing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>  They honoured you as such. The brotherhood
  You preach for practice, they gave unto you,
  You were their brother, they your brothers, too,
  And thus fraternal love they meted out,
  My people and myself are one in all
  Upon the heather slopes, amidst the dales,
  And all around the fortress Bawn co Pagh,
  We preach and practise Brotherhood in Men,
  Love is our guiding Star, our motive Pow’r,
  The Love for which our dear Isola died.”</p>

<div class='c011'>[<i>Both enter the Bawn co Pagh.</i></div>

<h3 class='c014'>SCENE IV.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the <i>Hall of Magnitude</i>. This, the most magnificent
public building in Infantlonia, is packed from floor
to ceiling with an immense crowd, all assembled to
hear the proclamation of King Hector, proposing a
new Constitution to his people, the repeal of old
and effete laws, and the substitution in their place
of laws suited to the immediate requirements of the
times. It has been announced that Vergli, Prince
of Scota, will be its mouthpiece, and the excitement
and expectation of the vast throng is intense.
Enter Vergli, attended by the Prince of Bernia and
Vulnar, Lord of Avenamore, various high functionaries
and friends, amongst whom are Maxim, Scrutus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and Verita. A scene of wild enthusiasm greets him,
and the welcome accorded him is unprecedented in
the annals of Saxscoberland, as ever having been
accorded to any other public favourite or prince of
the Saxscober dynasty.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli</i> (raising his hand to command silence) exclaims:
  “To some men, moments come into their lives,
  Which toiling for, they little dreamt to see.
  Though I have toiled for Right, I never thought
  That <i>I</i> should see its triumph and behold
  Dawn breaking in upon the brains of men.
  I thought to sow good seed and see it root,
  But dared not hope to reap the golden grain.
  Yet lo! we stand with sickles in our hands,
  Ready to reap the produce of our toil.
  It seems quite wonderful, it seems a dream,
  Yet ’tis not so, my friends. See you this scroll,
  It is the message of my lord, the King,
  A message to his people far and wide,
  Wherever floats Saxscober’s crimson flag,
  There will these words be wafted to our kin,
  And indirectly through them to the world.
  It is my proud and honoured task to-day
  To be the mouthpiece of Saxscober’s King.
  Yet ere I read his words I fain would say
  They are an echo of another’s voice,
  Who pleaded hard to have them realized,
  And died to win the Cause of Right and Truth.
  Hector shall reign, but by his side shall <i>reign</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>  The deathless voice which pleaded thus for them,
  While memory remains let none forget
  The glorious victory of Isola.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tumultuous cheering greets this assertion. When
silence is restored, Vergli proceeds to read King
Hector’s message to his people. It reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>            “TO MY PEOPLE.</p>

<p class='c009'>  “We stand upon the meeting of two ways.
  One leads to Peace and Comfort, Right and Truth,
  The other to the very opposite.
  Which shall we take, my people, which pursue?
  I counsel that the first shall be our choice.
  Counselling this, I now propose to you,
  An altered and a higher constitution,
  A Magna Charter giving Human Rights,
  Not to a few, but unto <i>ev’ryone</i>,
  The fact of birth into this life, the sole,
  The only proof of right to such a claim,
  Shall be required, and opportunity
  To every human being shall be given
  To live, and thrive, and never be in want.
  The Slums of Infantlonia and elsewhere
  <i>Must</i> by the law become prohibited.
  All men <i>must</i> dwell in decent tenements,
  In towns there must be gardens for the people,
  Each child, no matter what its birth, shall learn
  To be a useful member of the state,
  By being taught a trade, of which it can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>  Make choice itself approved of by its parents.
  When work is scarce, the State must give employment,
  Not the nigh penal work of the Poor House,
  But work where work shall be Co-operative,
  Men reaping as they sow, their proper share.
  Co-operative law must be the law,
  Wherever groups of human beings work,
  It is not right that one should benefit
  And on men’s toil become a millionaire,
  Reaping where others have not had a share
  Except in paltry doles, which we call wage.
  Vast ownership in land or property
  Should bear its duty of ‘wealth in excess,’
  And be a taxable commodity.
  Wealth must contribute to the public good.
  A millionaire is an unjust creation,
  The base result of wasted human toil,
  The offspring of a living Man Machine,
  Made to produce this creature’s holiday.
  Co-operative law disgorges wealth
  And makes it useful and distributable,
  Men who grow rich upon excessive toil,
  And give not to that toil its proper share,
  Are Master Murderer millionaires, unfit
  To be the holders of this hoarded wealth,
  Which, miser-like, they neither spend nor share.
  Only one remedy can heal this sore,
  It is that which we call Co-operation.
  So long as angry Nations stand like dogs,
  Facing each other with their grinders showing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>  Saxscoberland must be prepared for war,
  And spend thereon, alas! much of its wealth,
  But, be it my Life’s task to advocate
  The institution of Appealing Courts,
  Where Arbitration shall decide disputes
  And deftly patch up human differences.
  If our Erth’s Governments would all agree
  To melt their armies and wage bloodless war
  In all things International; then war
  Could never raise its grinning head again,
  Starved by the disappearance of its food—
  The human flocks and herds we breed and raise,
  Fatten and decorate expensively,
  In order to provide this Monster’s feast.
  Be it my task to plead that he shall die,
  My people, <i>help me</i> to exterminate him.
  We are the greatest Nation on our Erth,
  Surely, if we <i>are earnest</i> in endeavour,
  We can accomplish this desired end?
  Co-operate with me and let us strive,
  And we <i>shall</i> be successful in the end.
  Now to the matter of our Government,
  Saxscober calls its ruler a Monarch.
  What’s in a word? A mere form of letters.
  Hereditary is this Monarchy,
  Yet we unjustly give the male first call
  And make the eldest male born our Monarch.
  This is unjust. While Primogeniture
  Is the acknowledged law of Saxscober,
  The heir shall be the eldest born, and sex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>  Should not be made a Disinherited.
  Let this injustice be removed at once.
  And give each Sex equality of rights,
  Let law applying to all Succession
  Be altered to deny sex privilege—
  Which we so arrogantly arrogate.
  Another point connected with this matter
  Earnestly demands an alteration,
  Children should not usurp a parent’s power;
  Children should not stand in a parent’s place.
  The parents both should be the ruling pow’r,
  And so remain until Death takes them hence.
  ’Tis monstrous that a child should occupy
  The place that parent has a right to fill.
  Out on such partial, inconsiderate law,
  Born of immatured brains and puny thought.
  The King and Queen should both be reigning powers
  And the survivor hold the reins till death.
  This law, applying as it did of yore
  When William, Prince of Citron, was consort—
  And this law should apply to all <i>Succession</i>.
  Perish the unjust law which gives the child
  The right to occupy its parent’s place.
  This being so, let Monarchs have fair play—
  Let them be human beings not mere dolls,
  Let them have pow’r to vote and speak with you,
  Let them be otherwise than dressed-up shapes
  To be the objects of barbaric shows.
  Let the cheers greeting Monarchs be sincere,
  Given as to a fellow-worker, pray;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>  Not to mute flesh and blood nonentities
  But part of an acting Constitution.
  Monarchs should not be absolute, but free,
  Co-operation be the principle.
  I counsel, too, the House of Bores should be
  Elective like the House of Commonpersons,
  And that no Righ or Ardrigh have a seat
  Claiming such as our Spiritual peers.
  This brings me to the matter of the Church
  And the religion which now reigns supreme.
  There should be no State Church, but liberty
  To every man to feel that his own creed
  Was not an outcast one and unendowed.
  Let conscience have its freedom and all creeds
  Be self-supporting, not ignored by State,
  While one alone is bolstered up as right.
  I counsel, therefore, Disestablishment;
  First giving compensation to the Clergy.
  Let all men pray in secret and display
  Fade, as should fade barbaric practices.
  Force not upon your Sovereigns the disgrace
  Of swearing false allegiance to a lie,
  What greater Moral crime than to exclaim
  ‘I do believe that which I don’t believe’?
  Is not such utterance a sacrilege?
  Away, my people, with the reign of Lie,
  Let Truth prevail, let Honest Truth be law.
  Another urgent law requires attention,
  The Marriage law I mean. Marriage should be
  The Act which makes the Man and Woman one,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>  Accompanied by the solemn declaration
  ‘I am thy husband and thou art my wife,’
  ‘I am thy wife and thou art my husband,’
  Uttered in presence of two witnesses.
  This is the law of Scota and is fair,
  But Saxen law insists on marriage ties
  Being tied by its religious ceremony;
  Which makes the Woman utter slavish words,
  Which self-respecting women hate and loathe
  And some have absolutely scorned to say.
  My Merani refused to utter them
  And was, in consequence, adjudg’d unwed
  By the exacting laws of Saxenland.
  I say that she <i>was</i> wed by law of God,
  And, being wed, was lawfully my wife;
  The son she bore is Prince of Scota now,
  Made so by a late Act of Parliament,
  Specially drafted and passed into law
  At my most earnest prayer and intercession.
  It is my hope that our new Parliament
  Will sweep away every impediment
  To civil marriage, and destroy the law
  Which forces royalty to wed with such,
  Ordaining that the heir shall royal be.
  ’Tis an unnatural law and maketh sad
  The wedded life of many Sovereigns.
  In all we do let us be natural,
  Laws born of selfishness or ignorance
  Flout Nature and create unhappiness.
  Laws, to be fair, must recognise the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>  That all men must have Opportunity,
  And none shall be a Disinherited.
  Parliament is dissolved and I appeal,
  With all my heart, unto my countrymen
  To give me unmistakable response
  That my desire for justice shall prevail.
  By law, my women subjects cannot vote,
  More shame to such a law is all I say;
  Next Parliament shall sweep that law away
  And give us one with equal rights for all.
  Capacity and Merit are the tests
  Of human fitness which should e’er prevail;
  Nature and circumstances will select
  The fittest to perform Life’s many functions,
  Seek not to <i>force</i> on women Motherhood—
  A vast mistake <i>which breeds the puny Man</i>.
  Some women are not fit to bear a child,
  Some men are unfit to be Sires at all;
  To breed unhealthy offspring is a Crime
  Which our religion has concealed from men.
  To bring disease into the world is bad,
  To force this on a child is a foul shame.
  It is a sacred trust which Nature gives,
  That trust of giving Life, and should command
  The reverence of those to whom ’tis giv’n;
  Let this be plainly taught to either sex,
  Bring up the sexes to respect each other.
  Give lessons in the schools how Health is made
  And how ’tis kept, and how it bringeth joy.
  When Men believe that sickness need not be,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>  That human beings can be well and strong
  By living lives in keeping with good sense,
  A Nation of fair beings will arise
  With senses purified and thought increased—
  And knowledge drawing nearer day by day
  To those veiled secrets of the Universe
  Which we believe so foolishly are closed,
  And hidden mysteries for aye and aye;
  Hidden from feeble sight and clouded brain,
  From Thought as yet in an imperfect state,
  But when the Mind becomes a mighty pow’r
  Its eyes <i>will</i> penetrate the misty veil
  And clearly read what now it cannot do.
  Let education, therefore, elevate;
  Let it accomplish a vast revolution
  By giving children Nature’s noble truths,
  And focussing them on their pliant brains.
  <i>Teach Kindness in the schools.</i> Before all things
  Teach <i>its vast virtue</i> to the youthful mind.
  Let <i>the religion</i> taught, <i>be just this thing</i>
  Mingled with Justice, Fair Play and Sweet Love;
  <i>Love to all things that feel</i> and, like ourselves,
  Are sentient and possess the gift of Life.
  Perish, Cold Cruelty! <i>the hugest bar
  To Progress and Perfection</i> on this Erth.
  Thus, have I spoken to my countrymen,
  And ask them to return a Parliament
  Which shall not fear to work for Evolution;
  Strike down oppressive laws, creating those
  Which shall inaugurate The Golden Age
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>  Of Peace, Good Health and Happiness to all—
  That living <i>Life</i> for which Isola died.”</p>

<div class='c011'>[<i>Loud and prolonged cheers.</i></div>

<p class='c009'><i>Vergli.</i> “This is King Hector’s message, countrymen,
  In which the Spirit of Isola breathes—
  A Spirit whose chief element was love,
  Love the Creator of true happiness.
  Let this appeal go forth throughout the world
  And pierce into the brains and hearts of men.
  It shall prevail, because it is The Truth.
  It shall bear fruit, because it is pure seed.
  It shall establish its real Sovereignty,
  Because it is Reality not Sham.
  If all true hearts declare <i>it shall prevail</i>
  And <i>work</i> to bring about the Victory,
  That Victory will come with leaps and bounds,
  And bring rejoicing into ev’ry heart.
  Ah! yes, it <i>will</i> come. It was prophesied
  By lips whose last word echoed Victory,
  It was Isola’s message to the world
  Wherever moan The Disinherited.
  Arouse, ye Children of Saxscoberland,
  Hark to her Spirit speaking out aloud.
  The sound is Hector’s but his words are hers,
  His Message but the Echo of Isola’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>As Vergli ceases speaking, the immense audience
rises and cheers him again and again with
intense enthusiasm. Acquiescence in the
King’s wishes is carried unanimously, and
the meeting comes to an end.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>                “RESULTANT.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once, long ago, Death came and took my soul
And bore it far away through boundless space,
And left Earth turning round within that space
Moving along its path of Evolution.
“Where takest thou me, Death?” my soul enquired.
“To look on Life where perfect laws prevail,”
Made answer he whom my Earth fears so much.
And so I sped with Death on to a world
Where everywhere Love and Delight prevailed.
Death called it Erth. It was like my own Earth,
And yet how different in every way.
Everywhere Peace prevailed and Love enthralled,
The Men were handsome and the Women fair.
Bright fields of waving grain and fruits and flow’rs
Made beautiful the human dwelling-places.
There was no blood apparent anywhere—
The moans of vivisected animals,
The groans of millions slaughtered to make food,
The awful cruelties of War and Strife,
Had no existence on this planet Erth.
Women and Men did not disgrace each other,
But revelled in a sweet companionship,
Sharing in <i>all</i> things as the sexes should.
The children’s schools did not divide each sex
But taught to both a pure and natural law,
So that the very thought, in after-life,
Of Prostitution had no place or part
Within the brains of Nature’s true nurselings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Health was apparent in the multitude;
Vast kitchens, groaning stomachs were unknown;
Hunger alone proclaimed the feeding hour
And pure and bloodless food gave sustenance,
Partaken of in moderation and
Never indulged in after hunger ceased.
On Erth the secret of Real Health was known,
To eat as Nature bade and not to gorge.
And everywhere pure air prevailed and dwelt
By night and day within a people’s lungs,
And dwelling-places overlooked fair scenes,
The people living on their own loved land
And drawing from its nurture health and strength.
There lived on this bright Erth a King and Queen
Whose names were Escanior and Isola,
Who loved each other, whom the people loved
And who in turn truly loved their people.
Said Death unto my Soul: “In ages past
Thought woke the mind of Isola the first,
She whom the Erthians call their deathless Queen,
Because the Spirit which lit up her mind
Lives on and permeates the whole of Erth.
This Isola lived when this Erth was gross,
Cruel and Sensual, and fed on lies.
She, too, loved a fair youth—Escanior called—
Whom uncouth men murdered before her eyes,
Giving her to a King to be his slave,
And hold degrading post as Consort Queen.
But Isola’s spirit would <i>not</i> be a slave,
And so with others she opposed foul Wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>And, dying for the Right, won the King’s heart
To raise aloft the flag of Evolution.
Rest here awhile and I will tell the tale
Of how Isola lived, and ruled, and died;
But lives again in the resultant thought
Which found its birth in her evolving pow’r.”
I sat and listened while Death told the tale,
And learned how Erth had answered Hector’s prayer,
And given him and Vergli, and Vulnar
The pow’r to build on Erth a perfect State
Which it has been my joy to look upon,
And which here, or elsewhere, I’ll see again.
For Thought is Life, it cannot die, it lives,
And, in my Memory, I see that scene,
Not in a dream but in Reality,
When Vision wakes to Life my Thoughtful Soul.
As Erth is, so shall this Earth be in time
When Men believe the words of Isola.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Leamington Spa Courier and Warwickshire Standard</cite> of Jan. 31st,
1902, concluding a long review, writes:—“Lack of space prevents us
giving one tithe of its fine passages. In the ‘Death of Robespierre’ we
have a lurid scene from the Reign of Terror that might have come from
the pen of a Macaulay or an Aytoun. Another vivid historical picture is
to be found in the story of Nigel Bruce, brother of the heroic King
Robert Bruce. The death-song of Wallace has the true heroic ring.
For romance, tragic yet delightful, we must turn to the ‘Lure Witch of
the Alpine Glen’—a very fine poem. Pantheists will appreciate ‘A
Child’s Search for God.’... Perhaps the most delightful and refreshing
of the longer poems is an exquisitely told narrative of the Bavarian
Highlands (‘The Wandering Waif and the King’).... And ‘I Wandered
in the Market’ is a powerful plea for the dumb-stricken animal. For an
original and pleasingly put advocacy of the sacred rights of bird and beast,
‘The Judgment of Airielle’ stands prominent.... This book is really a
real, living, human production, and one which must ever be a joy to the
man or woman whom the cares of this world have not robbed of all that
is natural and unaffected.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Literary World</cite> of Dec. 30th remarks:—“‘Esterelle; or, The Lure
Witch of the Alpine Glen,’ fills fifty-six pages, and contains passages that
would do no discredit to poets of riper age and more mature mind.
Pathetic and beautiful thoughts are expressed on every page.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Yorkshire Herald</cite>, Jan. 2nd, 1902, concludes an appreciative review:—“Her
longer pieces are written with power and poetic fervour,
and had the gifted authoress devoted her talents solely to the composition
of poetry, the world of literature would have been all the richer for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Banff Journal</cite>, Feb. 1st, 1902, concluding a long review, says:—“The
book possesses elements which will ensure for the name of the
gifted authoress a permanent place among the poets of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a lengthy review <cite>The Dumfries Standard</cite> says:—“The whole volume
is richer in the promise of poetic greatness than most great poets can show
at so early an age; better than any extract the book itself will be, and for
the nobility of its sentiment, for the vein of genuine poetry that is in it
we have no word too cordial to recommend it.”—Dec. 4th, 1901.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ouida” writes:—“I am much moved by the pathos and beauty of
many of your poems. Thanks from my heart for the ‘Prayer for the
Dogs,’ and ‘Janet Lees’ is lovely. It should be reprinted everywhere,
and ‘Averille.’”—Dec. 3rd, 1901.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marie Corelli says:—“Your charming book of poems which I find
very fascinating.”—Dec. 6th, 1901.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Herald of the Golden Age</cite> for December says:—“This volume of
poems contains many gems of thought. There is a freshness and versatility
about the book that is quite unique. There can be no doubt that
the author possesses the poetic gift in a most marked degree.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Northern Scot</cite> of Feb. 15th, 1902, says:—“The whole volume is
rich in poetic greatness, and the yearnings of the child’s soul are beautifully
and pathetically expressed in every page. It is a fascinating book.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A Sailor writes from one of H. M. ironclads, Feb. 2nd, 1902:—“We
know many of the ‘Songs of a Child’ by heart. I can say every word of
‘Love Knots’ and ‘Why I Kissed the Soldier Boy’ and ‘Towards
Sadowa.’ I have never touched a drop of drink since I read ‘Drink’s
Curse.’ God bless the child who wrote these songs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A soldier writes from one of tho blockhouses in South Africa:—“Will
you let another ‘soldier boy’ thank you for that grand poem ‘Why I
Kissed the Soldier Boy’? It goes to every soldier’s heart straight as a
die. I simply love it. It is human to the backbone. What a splendid
poem ‘The Lure Witch of the Alpine Glen’ is; and I have read ‘The
Wandering Waif and the King’ over and over again. How I and my
mates have laughed over ‘The Raid of Ruby Roses’ from Sandringham.
We all hope Part II. will soon find its way here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Under date June 15th, 1902, Mr. George Jacob Holyoake writes:—“Dear
Lady Florence, ‘Abel Avenged’ is a splendid heresy, splendidly
set forth. It supplies what Milton omits, and what only a free spirit could
conceive, only an intrepid mind could express. The wealth of thought in
that epic and in the ‘Sceptic’s Defence’ is wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Herald of the Golden Age</cite> for June says:—“This additional volume
of poems, written by Lady Florence Dixie between the ages of twelve and
seventeen years, is a phenomenal production for one so young, and it will,
apart from the additional poems which are still awaiting publication,
establish her reputation as a poet. The dramatic tragedy, entitled ‘Abel
Avenged,’ evidences the doubts which orthodox religious teaching produces
in the minds of many children. It reminds one so strongly of
Milton’s style and depth of thought as to make one wonder how a girl
of fourteen could have been the author. Some of the poems which are
written in lighter vein are very charming and idyllic; two of the best of
these are ‘Before the lights come in,’ and ‘King Taija.’ A strong
humanitarian note is sounded in the poem entitled ‘A Ramble in Hell,’
which is an impassioned protest against the iniquities of Vivisection, and
demonstrates how early in life the gifted authoress became a champion on
the rights of animals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a long review of an advance copy of the book in <cite>The Agnostic
Journal</cite> of May 10, “Saladin” remarks in his “At Random” sketch:—“The
lyric [of the poem ‘Saladin’] is deft and musical, but it is the little
schoolgirl’s chivalrous treatment of him who was Christendom’s most formidable
foe that entitles the lines to distinction. To try a person or a cause
by his or its intrinsic merits, and not in the light of the extrinsic prejudices
with which it has come to be encrusted, is, in addition to the function of
a poet, the deed of a heroine.... The child’s precocious rejection of
religious orthodox is recorded in the ambitious dramatic effusion, ‘Abel
Revenged,’ an earnest and gifted child’s succedaneum for Byron’s ‘Cain.’
The assault upon Orthodoxy is, of course, delivered not from the critical
or historical, but from the moral side. The teaching of the Church is
impugned on the ground of its incompatibility with truth and justice, and—nobly
characteristic of the writer—for its disregard of the sufferings of
sentient creatures.... Any really educated lady of rank and fortune can
secretly hold unpopular tenets, but it takes a Douglas to avow them.
The volume here is of gold.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Dumfries Standard</cite>, under date June 28, says:—“These poems
exhibit a degree of intellectual daring and a maturity of speculative
thought in the realms of religion and morals that are amazing, and a
literary talent hardly less so. In ‘Abel Avenged’ one reads with a feeling
of astonishment the inexorable directness of the child’s logic and the skill
with which she discharges her function of critic in the action of a drama.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Northern Weekly</cite> of July 19 remarks:—“‘Songs of a Child’ shows
a passionate love of Nature, high ideals and a noble longing for truth,
and sympathy with all living things.... ‘A Ramble in Hell’ you cannot
forget once you have read it. Lady Florence has fronted the riddle of
the Universe in many poems and asked questions that are daring and
heterodox. ‘The Sceptic’s Defence’ is full of questions prompted by the
mystery and the misery of the world. ‘Abel Avenged’ is amazing as the
production of one so young.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Young Oxford</cite> for July says:—“In these songs the golden thread of
genius runs alike through tender lyric and daring drama. That a girl of
fourteen should have written ‘Abel Avenged’ is one of the marvels
of literature. Orthodoxy has created more than one epic, but let us hope
that never again will it have opportunity to fashion one from the brain
and nerve tissue of a child, for in the vigorous, sympathetic sketch of
‘Cain’ we see a free, truthful spirit beating in defiant despair against the
bars of a narrow theology&#160;... the old belief in a vengeful deity were not
dead, surely it would be killed by the remorseless logic of the child whose
ponderings resulted thus.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a letter dated May 1, the Editor of <cite>The Golden Age</cite> writes:—“Please
accept my warmest thanks for the pleasure you have given me, and let me
offer you my sincerest congratulations. The world has certainly been the
poorer in consequence of the delay in the publication of the poems, for
they are both beautiful and remarkable in many ways, to say nothing of
the helpful thought and sentiment contained in them. If ‘Abel Avenged’
had been issued as a lost manuscript (re-discovered) by Milton, no one
would have doubted the authenticity. Are you Milton re-incarnated?
I wonder! The manner in which you have thought out the deepest
problems of life and handled them in this poem and in ‘The Sceptic’s
Defense’ is remarkable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Reviewing an advance copy of this book, <cite>The Literary Guide</cite> for May
says:—“The perusal of the Second Part of Lady Florence Dixie’s poems
increases our astonishment at the extraordinary development of her
mental powers in early life. The present volume possesses special interest....
Her poetic drama, ‘Abel Avenged’ was written at the age of
fourteen, and one knows not whether to be most astounded at the boldness
of the language or the fact that at so early a period of life the doubts and
obstinate questionings which the work reveals should have arisen at all.
The chief personage is Cain, whose character is conceived with striking
power and sympathy.... Lady Florence Dixie is a writer who dares to
think for herself—one who can, moreover, express her ideas with refreshing
vigour and in most cases in unmistakable clearness. The Poetry of
Revolt and the Poetry of Sympathy for animal life are distinctly enriched
by the publication of this volume. To have performed such a service is
an achievement of which any author might be proud. That it should
have been done by a child is one of the most remarkable facts in present-day
literature.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Review of Reviews</cite> for July says:—“There is great pathetic interest
attaching to these poems and to the opening chapters of ‘Ijain,’&#160;...
and there is something touching in the longing desire so manifest in every
page of Lady Florence’s writings to save other children from the misery
through which she has emerged.... The story of Lady Florence’s
pilgrimage from the first plank in her atheistic platform to her present
position is told in ‘The Story of Ijain,’ which promises to be of considerable
interest. It is a kind of demonstration in vivisectional anatomy of
the living soul, from which most people would shrink&#160;... and those who
read it cannot fail to sympathise even if they do not agree.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>An American Appreciation.</span>—<cite>The Boston Press Writer</cite>, the organ
of the American Press Writers’ Association, Nov. 1902, says:—“We always
like to think of the great Iconoclasts as a Roman Gladiator, striding into
the arena armed with sword and shield hurling defiance at Cæsar and the
world; but what picture can imagination conjure up when a child steps
upon the scene and throws down the gauntlet which defies Cæsar and all
the world. Kindness steals up from every page like perfume from a
flower.... After reading the rubbish called poetry published to-day in
newspaper and magazine; oceans of words nicely joined together, but a
desert of ideas; it is refreshing to reach this oasis called ‘Songs of a Child.’
Sweet mingling of sentiment and philosophy.... You will find that
which rings as true as ‘A MAN’S A MAN, FOR A’ THAT.’...
Why should Humanity wait till its best friends have departed for ever,
before paying them a fitting tribute. Let us while they are still with us,
gather from the fields of thought the fairest flowers they have sown, and
weave them in a chaplet—‘Let us wreath the living brow.’ All thinkers,
liberal, progressive people, friends of ‘The New Thought,’ and those who
love Humanity and worship truth, should purchase this book and place it
in their libraries where it belongs, beside Burns, Byron and Shelley.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rev. J. P. Hopps, in <cite>The Coming Day</cite>, writes:—“A truly astonishing
book is ‘Songs of a Child and other Poems,’ by ‘Darling,’ (Lady Florence
Dixie), published by The Leadenhall Press, London, in two parts, now
issued in one volume. The writings of this wonderful child, the story of
whose childhood is promised, suggest the presence and inspiration of a
master spirit, fierce for freedom, daring in criticism, and splendid in
spiritual adventure. The poems are full of dash and fire, whether treating
of Nature and her wild delights or the mind-world with all its possibilities
of rapture and depression, joy and anguish, trust and horror. But the
wonder of it! The strenuous ‘Dramatic Tragedy’ of ‘Abel Avenged’
was written at fourteen and a half, and the militant ‘Sceptic’s Defence’ at
sixteen—both crammed with the rankest imaginable heresies. Throughout
the whole book there is hardly a line—perhaps not a line—which is mere
composition. It is all powder and shot, and morning and evening stars.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Daily Chronicle</cite>, Quebec, says:—“The poems represent the lyrical
activity of Lady Florence from the age of ten years to seventeen, and they
are presented to the public in the form in which they first appeared, untouched
and unrevised. Many of them are really so good, so musical, so
original in choice of topic, so vigorous in execution, so rich in allusion,
and often, so spirited, that one may well wonder how so youthful a poet
could turn out such work, and such creations. In the compass of six
hundred pages we have here the product of her pen for seven years,—only
a selection from a mass of manuscripts.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In an Epilogue on <span class='sc'>Ijain</span> “Saladin” (W. Stewart Ross) writes:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The breezy freshness of Ijain’s character is replete with simple but
insinuating charm. Her spirit, genial and generous, was never meant for
a cage. Hardly emerged from her cradle, her unsophisticated commonsense,
on its own initiative, anticipated the propositions of ‘the Higher
Criticism.’ She looked upon the dogmas of the popular faith, not through
conventionally-coloured spectacles, but with the vision of her own clear,
honest, fearless eyes; and the Father of Mercy have mercy upon Dogma
when it is thus surveyed!</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“When Ijain first threw down her play-things and began to regard the
world on her own account, with her new, not second-hand, type of mind,
she found, to her distress, that, before she had come into the world at all,
everything had been cut and dried for her. The thinking had all been
done for her by heads in the grave; and, to question the findings of those
heads in the grave meant obloquy here, and hell elsewhere.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“Ijain laid down these play-things that she might, without undue
distraction, think this finality over—and it did not meet with her endorsement.
There was nothing in her of the rebel for rebellion’s sake; but
there was much in her of the mettle of the martyr for Truth’s sake. She
adopted the more than Golden Rule, ‘To thine own self be true.’ She
took it for granted that it is with our own individual faculties we must
work out our own salvation, and that not with fear and trembling, but
with modest self-reliance and simple sincerity. She precociously grasped
the principle of Human Brotherhood, involving a repudiation of all racial
and credal prejudice. In the whole composition of the little heroine
there is no vestige of the braggart. There is the mortification of finding
herself in an environment in which all the vital questions of existence
had been finally settled thousands of years before she had been born,
and that by credulous hierophants thousands of years behind the highest
tide-mark of the intelligence of the present hour.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“The record of Ijain, with inimitable directness and simplicity,
exemplifies what everyone who really knows and sympathizes with
children knows, that the mind of the child is, naturally, in revolt against
our popular dogmas, ay, and in revolt against theism itself as held by the
orthodox. The affirmation that it was not Jesus, but Nigel, that, in a
certain crisis, saved Ijain from drowning, is an argument as forceful as it
is simple; and the mind, till, by the Nans and Miss O’Learies, it has
been warped and sophisticated, does not in an anthropomorphic deity find
the Œdipus to read the riddle of the cosmos. The child instinctively
knows what the philosopher, after his mind has been subjected to
theologic distortion, requires all his mental faculties to rediscover, and all
his moral courage to avow. Ijain, susceptibly intuitive child though she
was, did <i>not</i> find the god-idea instinctive. She anticipated Darwin, which
at the time, she had not read.</p>

<p class='c017'>‘The belief in God has often been advanced as not only the
greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between men
and the lower animals. It is, however, impossible, as we have seen,
to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive to man. On the
other hand, a belief in all pervading spiritual agencies seems to be
universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in
man’s reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of
imagination, curiosity and wondre. I am aware that the assumed
instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument
for his existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should
thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and
malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief
in them is far more general than in a beneficent deity.’</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“Moreover, in the immaculate simplicity of her soul, Ijain anticipated
an admission in one of the sermons of John Wesley which probably she
has not read even up to the present hour.</p>

<p class='c017'>‘After all that has been so plausibly written concerning “the
innate idea of God”; after all that has been said of its being common
to all men, in all ages and nations, it does not appear that man has
naturally any more idea of God than any of the beasts of the field;
he has no knowledge of God at all; no fear of God at all; neither is
God in all his thoughts. Whatever change may afterwards be wrought
(whether by grace of God, or his own reflections, or by education),
he is by nature a mere Atheist.’</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“And, even were the orthodox deity taken for granted, with her girlish
heart and tender sympathy with every living creature, Ijain’s whole nature
rose in revolt against the savage truculence of the deity of the churches.
She, instinctively, endorsed the sentiments of the philosopher of Ferney:—</p>

<p class='c017'>‘Whoever dares to say “God has spoken to me,” is criminal before
God and men; for would God, the common father of all men, have
communicated himself to an individual? God to walk! God to
talk! God to write upon a little mountain! God to become man!
God-man to die upon the cross! Ideas worthy of a <i>Punch</i>! To
invent all these things is the last degree of rascality; to believe them,
the extreme of brutal stupidity!’</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Ijain, if, in the reading of the Riddle of the Universe, we must
postulate deity, let us have <span class='sc'>God</span> expressive of the ripest knowledge, the
loftiest aspirations, the most transcendental spiritual vision of modern
humanity, not the coarse and barbaric eidolon of credulous and unlettered
savages. In respect of our intelligence, in mercy upon our feelings, give
us <span class='sc'>God</span> up to date.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>“The lesson the ‘story’ teaches is that</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>He prayeth best who loveth best,</div>
    <div>All things both great and small;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>that the world, in its noblest aspect, is an arena for generous and unselfish
endeavour; that, in service to your brother man, you are offering the
very service to God that any god born of a noble and spiritual ideal
would most readily accept. Ijain’s lesson is, Help Man, and, if it so
please you, call it worshiping God. The most divine of all the sayings
attributed to the Nazarine is, in regard to a kindly, helpful deed, ‘Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
have done it unto me.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little books printed about a hundred years ago “for the amusement
of little masters and misses” must now be looked for in the cabinets of the
curious. The type is quaint, the illustrations quainter and the grayish
tinted paper abounds in obtrusive specks of embedded dirt. For the covers,
gaudy Dutch gilt paper was used, or paper with patchy blobs of startlingly
contrasted colours laid on with a brush by young people. The text, always
amusing, is of course redolent of earlier days.</p>

the great principles which govern warfare is absolutely necessary to anyone
who would study the progress of the war in South Africa from any other
than a mere ‘win or lose’ standpoint, has ventured to place before the
public, in as small a compass as possible, an outline of those main truths,
the thorough knowledge of which is essential to the successful conduct
of a campaign. He hopes that—drawn as they are from experience and
from the recognised and standard works on the subject, by great military
writers—they may be found of some service in explaining the intricacies
of strategy, tactics and field fortification.”</p>

free to travel over the whole surface of the paper from top to bottom.
The height of Pad and Holder will be kept uniform if each written sheet

blotting paper instead of the old and useless cardboard. The ordinary

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
